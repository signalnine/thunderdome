# Creating Bundles with amplifier-foundation

**Purpose**: Guide for creating bundles to package AI agent capabilities using amplifier-foundation.

---

## What is a Bundle?

A **bundle** is a composable unit of configuration that produces a mount plan for AmplifierSession. Bundles package:

- **Tools** - Capabilities the agent can use
- **Agents** - Sub-agent definitions for task delegation
- **Hooks** - Observability and control mechanisms
- **Providers** - LLM backend configurations
- **Instructions** - System prompts and context
- **Spawn Policy** - Controls what tools spawned agents inherit

Bundles are the primary way to share and compose AI agent configurations.

**Key insight**: Bundles are **configuration**, not Python packages. A bundle repo does not need a root `pyproject.toml`.

---

## The Thin Bundle Pattern (Recommended)

**Most bundles should be thin** - inheriting from foundation and adding only their unique capabilities.

### The Problem

When creating bundles that include foundation, a common mistake is to **redeclare things foundation already provides**:

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Fat bundle that duplicates foundation
includes:
  - bundle: foundation

session:              # ❌ Foundation already defines this!
  orchestrator:
    module: loop-streaming
    source: git+https://github.com/...
  context:
    module: context-simple

tools:                # ❌ Foundation already has these!
  - module: tool-filesystem
    source: git+https://github.com/...
  - module: tool-bash
    source: git+https://github.com/...

hooks:                # ❌ Foundation already has these!
  - module: hooks-streaming-ui
    source: git+https://github.com/...
```

This duplication:
- Creates maintenance burden (update in two places)
- Can cause version conflicts
- Misses foundation updates automatically

### The Solution: Thin Bundles

A **thin bundle** only declares what it uniquely provides:

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Thin bundle inherits from foundation
---
bundle:
  name: my-capability
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Adds X capability

includes:
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation@main
  - bundle: my-capability:behaviors/my-capability    # Behavior pattern

---

# My Capability

@my-capability:context/instructions.md

---

@foundation:context/shared/common-system-base.md
```

**That's it.** All tools, session config, and hooks come from foundation.

### Exemplar: amplifier-bundle-recipes

See [amplifier-bundle-recipes](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes) for the canonical example:

```yaml
# amplifier-bundle-recipes/bundle.md - Only 14 lines of YAML!
---
bundle:
  name: recipes
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Multi-step AI agent orchestration for repeatable workflows

includes:
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation@main
  - bundle: recipes:behaviors/recipes
---

# Recipe System

@recipes:context/recipe-instructions.md

---

@foundation:context/shared/common-system-base.md
```

**Key observations**:
- No `tools:`, `session:`, or `hooks:` declarations (inherited from foundation)
- Uses behavior pattern for its unique capabilities
- References consolidated instructions file
- Minimal markdown body

---

## The Behavior Pattern

A **behavior** is a reusable capability add-on that bundles agents + context (and optionally tools/hooks). Behaviors live in `behaviors/` and can be included by any bundle.

### Why Behaviors?

Behaviors enable:
- **Reusability** - Add capability to any bundle
- **Modularity** - Separate concerns cleanly
- **Composition** - Mix and match behaviors

### Behavior File Structure

```yaml
# behaviors/my-capability.yaml
bundle:
  name: my-capability-behavior
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Adds X capability with agents and context

# Optional: Add tools specific to this capability
tools:
  - module: tool-my-capability
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-my-capability@main#subdirectory=modules/tool-my-capability

# Declare agents this behavior provides
agents:
  include:
    - my-capability:agent-one
    - my-capability:agent-two

# Declare context files this behavior includes
context:
  include:
    - my-capability:context/instructions.md
```

### Using Behaviors

Include a behavior in your bundle:

```yaml
includes:
  - bundle: foundation
  - bundle: my-capability:behaviors/my-capability   # From same bundle
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/org/bundle@main#subdirectory=behaviors/foo.yaml  # External
```

### Exemplar: recipes behavior

See [amplifier-bundle-recipes/behaviors/recipes.yaml](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes):

```yaml
bundle:
  name: recipes-behavior
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Multi-step AI agent orchestration via declarative YAML recipes

tools:
  - module: tool-recipes
    source: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes@main#subdirectory=modules/tool-recipes
    config:
      session_dir: ~/.amplifier/projects/{project}/recipe-sessions
      auto_cleanup_days: 7

agents:
  include:
    - recipes:recipe-author
    - recipes:result-validator

context:
  include:
    - recipes:context/recipe-instructions.md
```

**Key observations**:
- Adds a tool specific to this capability
- Declares the agents this behavior provides
- References consolidated context file
- Can be included by foundation OR any other bundle

### Agent Definition Patterns: Include vs Inline

**Both patterns are fully supported** by the code. Choose based on your needs:

#### Pattern 1: Include (Recommended for most cases)

```yaml
agents:
  include:
    - my-bundle:my-agent      # Loads agents/my-agent.md
```

**Use when**: Agent is self-contained with its own instructions in a separate `.md` file.

#### Pattern 2: Inline (Valid for tool-scoped agents)

```yaml
agents:
  my-agent:
    description: "Agent with bundle-specific tool access"
    instructions: my-bundle:agents/my-agent.md
    tools:
      - module: tool-special    # This agent gets specific tools
        source: ./modules/tool-special
```

**Use when**: Agent needs bundle-specific tool configurations that differ from the parent bundle.

#### When to Use Each

| Scenario | Pattern | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Standard agent with own instructions | Include | Cleaner separation, context sink pattern |
| Agent needs specific tools | Inline | Can specify `tools:` for just this agent |
| Agent reused across bundles | Include | Separate file is more portable |
| Agent tightly coupled to bundle | Inline | Keep definition with bundle config |

**Key insight**: The code in `bundle.py:_parse_agents()` explicitly handles both patterns:
> "Handles both include lists and direct definitions."

Neither pattern is deprecated. Both are intentional design choices for different use cases.

---

## Context De-duplication

**Consolidate instructions into a single file** rather than inline in bundle.md.

### The Problem

Inline instructions in bundle.md cause:
- Duplication if behavior also needs to reference them
- Large bundle.md files that are hard to maintain
- Harder to reuse context across bundles

### The Solution: Consolidated Context Files

Create `context/instructions.md` with all the instructions:

```markdown
# My Capability Instructions

You have access to the my-capability tool...

## Usage

[Detailed instructions]

## Agents Available

[Agent descriptions]
```

Reference it from your behavior:

```yaml
# behaviors/my-capability.yaml
context:
  include:
    - my-capability:context/instructions.md
```

And from your bundle.md:

```markdown
---
bundle:
  name: my-capability
includes:
  - bundle: foundation
  - bundle: my-capability:behaviors/my-capability
---

# My Capability

@my-capability:context/instructions.md

---

@foundation:context/shared/common-system-base.md
```

### Exemplar: recipes instructions

See [amplifier-bundle-recipes/context/recipe-instructions.md](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes):
- Single source of truth for recipe system instructions
- Referenced by both `behaviors/recipes.yaml` AND `bundle.md`
- No duplication

---

## Directory Conventions

Bundle repos follow **conventions** that enable maximum reusability and composition. These are patterns, not code-enforced rules.

> **Structural vs Conventional**: Bundles have two independent classification systems. For **structural** concepts (root bundles, nested bundles, namespace registration), see [CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md#bundle-loading-structural-concepts). This section covers **conventional** organization patterns.

### Standard Directory Layout

| Directory | Convention Name | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| `/bundle.md` | **Root bundle** | Repo's primary entry point, establishes namespace |
| `/bundles/*.yaml` | **Standalone bundles** | Pre-composed, ready-to-use variants (e.g., "with-anthropic") |
| `/behaviors/*.yaml` | **Behavior bundles** | "The value this repo provides" - compose onto YOUR bundle |
| `/providers/*.yaml` | **Provider bundles** | Provider configurations to compose |
| `/agents/*.md` | **Agent files** | Specialized agent definitions |
| `/context/*.md` | **Context files** | Shared instructions, knowledge |
| `/modules/` | **Local modules** | Tool implementations specific to this bundle |
| `/docs/` | **Documentation** | Guides, references, examples |

### Directory Purposes

**Root bundle** (`/bundle.md`): The primary entry point for your bundle. Establishes the namespace (from `bundle.name`) and typically includes its own behavior for DRY. This is both structurally a "root bundle" and conventionally the main entry point.

**Standalone bundles** (`/bundles/*.yaml`): Pre-composed variants ready to use as-is. Typically combine the root bundle with a provider choice. Examples: `with-anthropic.yaml`, `minimal.yaml`. These are structurally "nested bundles" (loaded via `namespace:bundles/foo`) but conventionally "standalone" because they're complete and ready to use.

**Behavior bundles** (`/behaviors/*.yaml`): The reusable capability this repo provides. When someone wants to add your capability to THEIR bundle, they include your behavior. Contains agents, context, and optionally tools. The root bundle should include its own behavior (DRY pattern).

**Provider bundles** (`/providers/*.yaml`): Provider configurations that can be composed onto other bundles. Allows users to choose which provider to use without the bundle author making that decision.

### The Recommended Pattern

1. **Put your main value in `/behaviors/`** - this is what others compose onto their bundles
2. **Root bundle includes its own behavior** - DRY, root bundle stays thin
3. **`/bundles/` offers pre-composed variants** - convenience for users who want ready-to-run combinations

```yaml
# bundle.md (root) - thin, includes own behavior
bundle:
  name: my-capability
  version: 1.0.0

includes:
  - bundle: foundation
  - bundle: my-capability:behaviors/my-capability  # DRY: include own behavior
```

```yaml
# bundles/with-anthropic.yaml - standalone variant
bundle:
  name: my-capability-anthropic
  version: 1.0.0

includes:
  - bundle: my-capability                           # Root already has behavior
  - bundle: foundation:providers/anthropic-opus     # Add provider choice
```

### Structural vs Conventional Classification

A bundle can be classified in BOTH systems independently:

| Bundle | Structural | Conventional |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| `/bundle.md` | Root (`is_root=True`) | Root bundle |
| `/bundles/with-anthropic.yaml` | Nested (`is_root=False`) | Standalone bundle |
| `/behaviors/my-capability.yaml` | Nested (`is_root=False`) | Behavior bundle |
| `/providers/anthropic-opus.yaml` | Nested (`is_root=False`) | Provider bundle |

**Key insight:** A "standalone bundle" (conventional) is still a "nested bundle" (structural) when loaded via `namespace:bundles/foo.yaml`. These aren't contradictions—they describe different aspects.

## Bundle Directory Structure

### Thin Bundle (Recommended)

```
my-bundle/
├── bundle.md                 # Thin: includes + context refs only
├── behaviors/
│   └── my-capability.yaml    # Reusable behavior
├── agents/                   # Agent definitions
│   ├── agent-one.md
│   └── agent-two.md

├── docs/                     # Additional documentation
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── SECURITY.md
└── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
```

### Bundle with Local Modules

```
my-bundle/
├── bundle.md
├── behaviors/
│   └── my-capability.yaml
├── agents/
├── context/
├── modules/                  # Local modules (when needed)
│   └── tool-my-capability/
│       ├── pyproject.toml    # Module's package config
│       └── my_module/
├── docs/
├── README.md
└── ...
```

**Note**: No `pyproject.toml` at the root. Only modules inside `modules/` need their own `pyproject.toml`.

### Hybrid Bundle (Standalone CLI + Bundle Assets) - Rare

> **When do you need this?** Only when your bundle provides a **standalone CLI tool** (installed via `uv tool install`) that **requires bundle assets at runtime** to function. Examples: `amplifier-bundle-shadow` provides the `amplifier-shadow` CLI which needs container configs.
>
> **Most bundles don't need this.** If your bundle just provides agents, tools, and context for use within Amplifier sessions, use the standard pure bundle pattern above. Put tool functionality in `modules/tool-*/` subdirectories.

Some bundles provide BOTH a standalone Python CLI tool AND bundle configuration (agents, context, etc.). These require careful packaging to avoid conflicts.

```
my-hybrid-bundle/
├── pyproject.toml            # Python package config
├── src/my_package/           # Python code
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── cli.py
│   └── _bundle/              # Bundle assets INSIDE package
│       ├── bundle.yaml
│       ├── agents/
│       └── context/
├── modules/                  # Tool modules (separate packages)
│   └── tool-my-tool/
├── bundle.md                 # Root entry point
└── README.md
```

**Key pattern**: Bundle assets go in a `_bundle/` subdirectory INSIDE the Python package, not at the package root.

**Why?** When using hatch's `force-include` to put non-Python files in a wheel, the target path must NOT shadow the Python package namespace. See [Packaging Anti-Patterns](#-force-include-shadowing-python-namespace) below.

**pyproject.toml for hybrid bundles:**

```toml
[project]
name = "my-hybrid-bundle"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = [...]

[project.scripts]
my-cli = "my_package.cli:main"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/my_package"]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]
# Assets go INSIDE package, in _bundle/ subdirectory
"bundle.yaml" = "my_package/_bundle/bundle.yaml"
"agents" = "my_package/_bundle/agents"
"context" = "my_package/_bundle/context"
```

**Testing hybrid packages**: Always test with a built wheel, not just editable installs:

```bash
uv build --wheel
uv pip install dist/*.whl --force-reinstall
python -c "from my_package import SomeClass"  # Verify imports work
```

Editable installs use source directories and may mask packaging bugs that only appear in built wheels.

## Creating a Bundle Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Decide Your Pattern

**Ask yourself**:
- Does my bundle add capability to foundation? → **Use thin bundle + behavior pattern**
- Is my bundle standalone (no foundation dependency)? → Declare everything you need
- Do I want my capability reusable by other bundles? → **Create a behavior**

### Step 2: Create Behavior (if adding to foundation)

Create `behaviors/my-capability.yaml`:

```yaml
bundle:
  name: my-capability-behavior
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Adds X capability

agents:
  include:
    - my-capability:my-agent

context:
  include:
    - my-capability:context/instructions.md
```

### Step 3: Create Consolidated Instructions

Create `context/instructions.md`:

```markdown
# My Capability Instructions

You have access to the my-capability tool for [purpose].

## Available Agents

- **my-agent** - Does X, useful for Y

## Usage Guidelines

[Instructions for the AI on how to use this capability]
```

### Step 4: Create Agent Definitions

Place agent files in `agents/` with proper frontmatter:

```markdown
---
meta:
  name: my-agent
  description: "Description shown when listing agents. Include usage examples..."
---

# My Agent

You are a specialized agent for [specific purpose].

## Your Capabilities

[Agent-specific instructions]
```

### Step 5: Create Thin bundle.md

```markdown
---
bundle:
  name: my-capability
  version: 1.0.0
  description: Provides X capability

includes:
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-foundation@main
  - bundle: my-capability:behaviors/my-capability
---

# My Capability

@my-capability:context/instructions.md

---

@foundation:context/shared/common-system-base.md
```

### Step 6: Add README and Standard Files

Create README.md documenting:
- What the bundle provides
- The architecture (thin bundle + behavior pattern)
- How to load/use it

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Duplicating Foundation

```yaml
# DON'T DO THIS when you include foundation
includes:
  - bundle: foundation

tools:
  - module: tool-filesystem     # Foundation has this!
    source: git+https://...

session:
  orchestrator:                 # Foundation has this!
    module: loop-streaming
```

**Why it's bad**: Creates maintenance burden, version conflicts, misses foundation updates.

**Fix**: Remove duplicated declarations. Foundation provides them.

### ❌ Inline Instructions in bundle.md

```yaml
---
bundle:
  name: my-bundle
---

# Instructions

[500 lines of instructions here]

## Usage

[More instructions]
```

**Why it's bad**: Can't be reused by behavior, hard to maintain, can't be referenced separately.

**Fix**: Move to `context/instructions.md` and reference with `@my-bundle:context/instructions.md`.

### ❌ Skipping the Behavior Pattern

```yaml
# DON'T DO THIS for capability bundles
---
bundle:
  name: my-capability

includes:
  - bundle: foundation

agents:
  include:
    - my-capability:agent-one
    - my-capability:agent-two
---

[All instructions inline]
```

**Why it's bad**: Your capability can't be added to other bundles without including your whole bundle.

**Fix**: Create `behaviors/my-capability.yaml` with agents + context, then include it.

### ❌ Fat Bundles for Simple Capabilities

```yaml
# DON'T create complex bundles when a behavior would suffice
---
bundle:
  name: simple-feature
  version: 1.0.0

includes:
  - bundle: foundation

session:
  orchestrator: ...    # Unnecessary
  context: ...         # Unnecessary

tools:
  - module: tool-x     # Could be in behavior
    source: ...

agents:
  include:             # Could be in behavior
    - simple-feature:agent-a
---

[Instructions that could be in context/]
```

**Fix**: If you're just adding agents + maybe a tool, use a behavior YAML only.

### ❌ Using @ Prefix in YAML

```yaml
# DON'T DO THIS - @ prefix is for markdown only
context:
  include:
    - "@my-bundle:context/instructions.md"   # ❌ @ doesn't belong here

agents:
  include:
    - "@my-bundle:my-agent"                  # ❌ @ doesn't belong here
```

```yaml
# DO THIS - bare namespace:path in YAML
context:
  include:
    - my-bundle:context/instructions.md      # ✅ No @ in YAML

agents:
  include:
    - my-bundle:my-agent                     # ✅ No @ in YAML
```

**Why it's wrong**: The `@` prefix is markdown syntax for eager file loading. YAML sections use bare `namespace:path` references. Using `@` in YAML causes **silent failure** - the path won't resolve and content won't load, with no error message.

### ❌ Using Repository Name as Namespace

```yaml
# If loading: git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes@main
# And bundle.name in that repo is: "recipes"

# DON'T DO THIS
agents:
  include:
    - amplifier-bundle-recipes:recipe-author   # ❌ Repo name

# DO THIS
agents:
  include:
    - recipes:recipe-author                    # ✅ bundle.name value
```

**Why it's wrong**: The namespace is ALWAYS `bundle.name` from the YAML frontmatter, regardless of the git URL, repository name, or file path.

### ❌ Including Subdirectory in Paths

```yaml
# If loading: git+https://...@main#subdirectory=bundles/foo
# And bundle.name is: "foo"

# DON'T DO THIS
context:
  include:
    - foo:bundles/foo/context/instructions.md   # ❌ Redundant path

# DO THIS
context:
  include:
    - foo:context/instructions.md               # ✅ Relative to bundle location
```

**Why it's wrong**: When loaded via `#subdirectory=X`, the bundle root IS `X/`. Paths are relative to that root, so including the subdirectory in the path duplicates it.

### Understanding `context.include` vs `@mentions` - They Have Different Semantics!

These two patterns are **NOT interchangeable** - they have fundamentally different composition behavior:

| Pattern | Composition Behavior | Use When |
|---------|---------------------|----------|
| `context.include` | **ACCUMULATES** - content propagates to including bundles | Behaviors that inject context into parents |
| `@mentions` | **REPLACES** - stays with this instruction only | Direct references in your own instruction |

#### How `context.include` Works (bundle.py:174-186)

When Bundle A includes Bundle B, **all context from both bundles merges**:

```python
# During compose(): context ACCUMULATES
for key, path in other.context.items():
    result.context[prefixed_key] = path  # Added to composed result!
```

Content is **appended** to the system prompt with `# Context: {name}` headers.

#### How `@mentions` Work (bundle.py:958-977)

@mentions are resolved from the **final instruction** and content is **prepended** as XML:

```xml
<context_file paths="@my-bundle:context/file.md → /abs/path">
[file content]
</context_file>

---

[instruction with @mention still present as semantic reference]
```

#### When to Use Each Pattern

**Use `context.include` in behaviors (`.yaml` files):**
```yaml
# behaviors/my-behavior.yaml
# This context will propagate to ANY bundle that includes this behavior
context:
  include:
    - my-bundle:context/behavior-instructions.md
```

**Use `@mentions` in root bundles (`.md` files):**
```markdown
---
bundle:
  name: my-bundle
---

# Instructions

@my-bundle:context/my-instructions.md    # Stays with THIS instruction
```

#### Why This Matters

If you use `context.include` in a root bundle.md:
- That context will propagate to any bundle that includes yours
- May not be what you intended for a "final" bundle

If you use `@mentions` in a behavior:
- The instruction (containing the @mention) **replaces** during composition
- Your @mention may get overwritten by the including bundle's instruction

**The pattern exists for a reason**: Behaviors use `context.include` because they WANT their context to propagate. Root bundles use `@mentions` because they're the final instruction.

### ❌ force-include Shadowing Python Namespace

```toml
# DON'T DO THIS - shadows the Python package!
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/my_package"]

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]
"agents" = "my_package/agents"        # ❌ Creates my_package/ with no __init__.py!
"context" = "my_package/context"      # ❌ Shadows the actual Python package
```

```toml
# DO THIS - use _bundle/ subdirectory
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]
"agents" = "my_package/_bundle/agents"      # ✅ Inside package, won't shadow
"context" = "my_package/_bundle/context"    # ✅ Python imports still work
```

**Why it's wrong**: hatch's `force-include` creates directories in the wheel. If you target `my_package/agents`, it creates a `my_package/` directory with just `agents/` inside (no `__init__.py`, no Python code). Python finds this directory first and treats it as a namespace package, **shadowing your actual Python package**. Result: `from my_package import X` fails with `ImportError`.

**The fix**: Put non-Python assets in a subdirectory like `_bundle/` or `data/` inside the package namespace.

**Critical**: This bug only appears in built wheels, not editable installs. Always test with `uv build && uv pip install dist/*.whl`.

### ❌ Declaring amplifier-core as Runtime Dependency

```toml
# DON'T DO THIS in modules/tool-*/pyproject.toml
[project]
dependencies = [
    "amplifier-core>=1.0.0",           # ❌ Not on PyPI, will fail
    "amplifier-bundle-foo>=0.1.0",     # ❌ Not on PyPI, will fail
]
```

```toml
# DO THIS - no runtime dependencies for tool modules
[project]
dependencies = []   # ✅ amplifier-core is a peer dependency
```

**Why it's wrong**: Tool modules run inside the host application's process (amplifier-app-cli), which already has `amplifier-core` loaded. These packages aren't on PyPI, so declaring them as dependencies causes installation failures.

**The pattern**: `amplifier-core` and bundle packages are **peer dependencies** - they're provided by the runtime environment, not installed as dependencies.

## Decision Framework

### When to Include Foundation

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Adding capability to AI assistants | ✅ Include foundation |
| Creating standalone tool | ❌ Don't need foundation |
| Need base tools (filesystem, bash, web) | ✅ Include foundation |
| Building on existing bundle | ✅ Include that bundle |

### When to Use Behaviors

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Adding agents + context | ✅ Use behavior |
| Adding tool + agents | ✅ Use behavior |
| Want others to use your capability | ✅ Use behavior |
| Creating a simple bundle variant | ❌ Just use includes |

### When to Create Local Modules

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Tool is bundle-specific | ✅ Keep in `modules/` |
| Tool is generally useful | ❌ Extract to separate repo |
| Multiple bundles need the tool | ❌ Extract to separate repo |

## Bundle File Structure

A bundle is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
bundle:
  name: my-bundle
  version: 1.0.0
  description: What this bundle provides

includes:
  - bundle: foundation              # Inherit from other bundles
  - bundle: my-bundle:behaviors/x   # Include behaviors

# Only declare tools NOT inherited from includes
tools:
  - module: tool-name
    source: ./modules/tool-name     # Local path
    config:
      setting: value

# Control what tools spawned agents inherit
spawn:
  exclude_tools: [tool-task]        # Agents inherit all EXCEPT these
  # OR use explicit list:
  # tools: [tool-a, tool-b]         # Agents get ONLY these tools

agents:
  include:
    - my-bundle:agent-name          # Reference agents in this bundle

# Only declare hooks NOT inherited from includes
hooks:
  - module: hooks-custom
    source: git+https://github.com/...

## Source URI Formats

Bundles support multiple source formats for modules:

| Format | Example | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Local path | `./modules/my-module` | Modules within the bundle |
| Relative path | `../shared-module` | Sibling directories |
| Git URL | `git+https://github.com/org/repo@main` | External modules |
| Git with subpath | `git+https://github.com/org/repo@main#subdirectory=modules/foo` | Module within larger repo |

**Local paths are resolved relative to the bundle's location.**

---

## Composition with includes:

Bundles can inherit from other bundles:

```yaml
includes:
  - bundle: foundation                    # Well-known bundle name
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/...    # Git URL
  - bundle: ./bundles/variant.yaml        # Local file
  - bundle: my-bundle:behaviors/foo       # Behavior within same bundle
```

**Merge rules**:
- Later bundles override earlier ones
- `session`: deep-merged (nested dicts merged recursively, later wins for scalars)
- `spawn`: deep-merged (later overrides earlier)
- `providers`, `tools`, `hooks`: merged by module ID (configs for same module are deep-merged)
- `agents`: merged by agent name (later wins)
- `context`: accumulates with namespace prefix (each bundle contributes without collision)
- Markdown instructions: replace entirely (later wins)

---

## App-Level Runtime Injection

Bundles define **what** capabilities exist. Apps inject **how** they run at runtime.

### What Apps Inject

| Injection | Source | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Provider configs | `settings.yaml` providers | API keys, model selection |
| Tool configs | `settings.yaml` modules.tools | `allowed_write_paths` for filesystem |
| Session overrides | Session-scoped settings | Temporary path permissions |

### Settings Structure

```yaml
# ~/.amplifier/settings.yaml
providers:
  - module: provider-anthropic
    config:
      api_key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}

modules:
  tools:
    - module: tool-filesystem
      config:
        allowed_write_paths:
          - /home/user/projects
          - ~/.amplifier
```

Tool configs are **deep-merged by module ID** - your settings extend the bundle's config, not replace it.

### Implications for Bundle Authors

**Don't declare in bundles:**
- Provider API keys or model preferences → App injects from settings
- Environment-specific paths → App injects via tool config
- User preferences → App handles them

**This enables:**
- Same bundle works across environments
- Secrets stay out of version control
- Apps can restrict/expand tool capabilities per context

### The Full Composition Chain

```
Foundation → Your bundle → App settings → Session overrides
    ↓            ↓              ↓               ↓
 (tools)     (agents)     (providers,      (temporary
                          tool configs)     permissions)
```

### Policy Behaviors

Some behaviors are **app-level policies** that should:
- Only apply to root/interactive sessions (not sub-agents or recipe steps)
- Be added by the app, not baked into bundles
- Be configurable per-app context

**Examples of policy behaviors:**
- Notifications (don't notify for every sub-agent)
- Cost tracking alerts
- Session duration limits

**Pattern for bundle authors:**
If your behavior should be a policy (root-only, app-controlled):
1. **Don't include it in your bundle.md** - provide it as a separate behavior
2. **Document it as a policy behavior** - so apps know to compose it
3. **Check `parent_id` in hooks** - skip sub-sessions by default

```python
# In your hook
async def handle_event(self, event: str, data: dict) -> HookResult:
    # Policy behavior: skip sub-sessions
    if data.get("parent_id"):
        return HookResult(action="continue")
    # ... root session logic
```

**Pattern for app developers:**
Configure policy behaviors in `settings.yaml`:

```yaml
config:
  notifications:
    desktop:
      enabled: true
    push:
      enabled: true
      service: ntfy
      topic: "my-topic"
```

The app composes these behaviors onto bundles at runtime, only for root sessions.

For detailed guidance, see [POLICY_BEHAVIORS.md](POLICY_BEHAVIORS.md).

## Using @mentions for Context

Reference files in your bundle's instructions without a separate `context:` section:

```markdown
---
bundle:
  name: my-bundle
---

# Instructions

Follow the guidelines in @my-bundle:docs/GUIDELINES.md

For API details, see @my-bundle:docs/API.md
```

**Format**: `@namespace:path/to/file.md`

The namespace is the bundle name. Paths are relative to the bundle root.

### Syntax Quick Reference

There are two different syntaxes for referencing files, and they are **NOT interchangeable**:

| Location | Syntax | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Markdown body** (bundle.md, agents/*.md) | `@namespace:path` | `@my-bundle:context/guide.md` |
| **YAML sections** (context.include, agents.include) | `namespace:path` (NO @) | `my-bundle:context/guide.md` |

The `@` prefix is **only** for markdown text that gets processed during instruction loading. YAML sections use bare `namespace:path` references.

See [Anti-Patterns to Avoid](#anti-patterns-to-avoid) for common syntax mistakes.

## Load-on-Demand Pattern (Soft References)

Not all context needs to load at session start. Use **soft references** (text without `@`) to make content available without consuming tokens until needed.

### The Problem

Every `@mention` loads content eagerly at session creation, consuming tokens immediately:

```
# These ALL load at session start (~15,000 tokens)
# Syntax: @<bundle>:<path>
foundation:docs/BUNDLE_GUIDE.md      # ~5,700 tokens
amplifier:docs/MODULES.md            # ~4,600 tokens  
recipes:examples/code-review.yaml    # ~5,000 tokens
```

*(Prepend `@` to each line above to see actual eager loading)*

### The Solution: Soft References

Reference files by path WITHOUT the `@` prefix. The AI can load them on-demand via `read_file`:

```markdown
**Documentation (load on demand):**
- Schema: recipes:docs/RECIPE_SCHEMA.md
- Examples: recipes:examples/code-review-recipe.yaml
- Guide: foundation:docs/BUNDLE_GUIDE.md
```

The AI sees these references and can load them when actually needed.

### When to Use Each Pattern

| Pattern | Syntax | Loads | Use When |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| **@mention** | `@bundle:path` | Immediately | Content is ALWAYS needed |
| **Soft reference** | `bundle:path` (no @) | On-demand | Content is SOMETIMES needed |
| **Agent delegation** | Delegate to expert agent | When spawned | Content belongs to a specialist |

### Best Practice: Context Sink Agents

For heavy documentation, create specialized "context sink" agents that @mention the docs. The root session stays light; heavy context loads only when that agent is spawned.

**Example**: Instead of @mentioning MODULES.md (~4,600 tokens) in the root bundle:

```
# BAD: Heavy root context (in bundle.md)
amplifier:docs/MODULES.md   # <- @mention loads ~4,600 tokens every session
```

Create an expert agent that owns that knowledge:

```
# GOOD: In agents/ecosystem-expert.md (agent owns this knowledge)
amplifier:docs/MODULES.md            # <- @mention here loads only when agent spawns
amplifier:docs/REPOSITORY_RULES.md   # <- same - deferred loading
```

The root bundle uses a soft reference and delegates:

```markdown
# Root bundle.md
For ecosystem questions, delegate to amplifier:amplifier-expert which has
authoritative access to amplifier:docs/MODULES.md and related documentation.
```

### Key Insight

**Every @mention is a token budget decision.** Ask yourself:
- Is this content needed for EVERY conversation? -> @mention
- Is this content needed for SOME conversations? -> Soft reference
- Does this content belong to a specific domain? -> Move to specialist agent

## Loading a Bundle

```bash
# Load from local file
amplifier run --bundle ./bundle.md "prompt"

# Load from git URL
amplifier run --bundle git+https://github.com/org/amplifier-bundle-foo@main "prompt"

# Include in another bundle
includes:
  - bundle: git+https://github.com/org/amplifier-bundle-foo@main
```

---

## Best Practices

### Use the Thin Bundle Pattern

When including foundation, don't redeclare what it provides. Your bundle.md should be minimal.

### Create Behaviors for Reusability

Package your agents + context in `behaviors/` so others can include just your capability.

### Consolidate Instructions

Put instructions in `context/instructions.md`, not inline in bundle.md.

### Keep Modules Local When Possible

For bundle-specific tools, keep them in `modules/` within the bundle:
- Simpler distribution (one repo)
- Versioning stays synchronized
- No external dependency management

Extract to separate repo only when:
- Multiple bundles need the same module
- Module needs independent versioning
- Module is generally useful outside the bundle

### Use Descriptive Agent Metadata

The `meta.description` is shown when listing agents. Include:
- What the agent does
- When to use it
- Usage examples in the description string

### No Root pyproject.toml

Bundles are configuration, not Python packages. Don't add a `pyproject.toml` at the bundle root.

## Complete Example: amplifier-bundle-recipes

See [amplifier-bundle-recipes](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-recipes) for the canonical example of the thin bundle + behavior pattern:

```
amplifier-bundle-recipes/
├── bundle.md                 # THIN: 14 lines of YAML, just includes
├── behaviors/
│   └── recipes.yaml          # Behavior: tool + agents + context
├── agents/
│   ├── recipe-author.md      # Conversational recipe creation
│   └── result-validator.md   # Pass/fail validation
├── context/
│   └── recipe-instructions.md  # Consolidated instructions
├── modules/
│   └── tool-recipes/         # Local tool implementation
├── docs/                     # Comprehensive documentation
├── examples/                 # Working examples
├── templates/                # Starter templates
├── README.md
└── ...
```

**Key patterns demonstrated**:
- **Thin bundle.md** - Only includes foundation + behavior
- **Behavior pattern** - `behaviors/recipes.yaml` defines the capability
- **Context de-duplication** - Instructions in `context/recipe-instructions.md`
- **Local module** - `modules/tool-recipes/` with source reference
- **No duplication** - Nothing from foundation is redeclared

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors

- Verify `source:` path is correct relative to bundle location
- Check module has `pyproject.toml` with entry point
- Ensure `mount()` function exists in module

### Agent not loading

- Verify `meta:` frontmatter exists with `name` and `description`
- Check agent file is in `agents/` directory
- Verify `agents: include:` uses correct namespace prefix

### @mentions not resolving

- Verify file exists at the referenced path
- Check namespace matches bundle name
- Ensure path is relative to bundle root

### Behavior not applying

- Verify behavior YAML syntax is correct
- Check include path: `my-bundle:behaviors/name` (not `my-bundle:behaviors/name.yaml`)
- Ensure behavior declares `agents:` and/or `context:` sections
