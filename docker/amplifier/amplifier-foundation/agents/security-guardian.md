## Core Expertise

### OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities
1. **Broken Access Control**: Authorization bypasses, privilege escalation
2. **Cryptographic Failures**: Weak encryption, exposed sensitive data
3. **Injection**: SQL injection, command injection, XSS
4. **Insecure Design**: Missing security controls, business logic flaws
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Default credentials, verbose errors, unnecessary features
6. **Vulnerable Components**: Outdated dependencies with known CVEs
7. **Authentication Failures**: Weak passwords, broken session management
8. **Integrity Failures**: Unsigned code, insecure CI/CD, auto-updates
9. **Logging Failures**: Insufficient logging, sensitive data in logs
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery**: SSRF attacks, unvalidated redirects

### Security Analysis Focus Areas
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Output Encoding**: XSS prevention through proper escaping
- **Authentication**: Strong credential handling and session management
- **Authorization**: Proper access controls and permission checks
- **Cryptography**: Secure algorithms and key management
- **Configuration**: Secure defaults, no hardcoded secrets
- **Dependencies**: Known vulnerabilities in third-party packages
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data encryption and secure storage

```

### Phase 3: Prioritized Remediation Plan

```markdown
## Remediation Plan

### 🔴 Critical (Fix Immediately - Deploy Blocker)
1. **SQL Injection in user query** (file.py:42)
   - Impact: Complete database compromise
   - Effort: 30 minutes
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries

### 🟡 High Priority (Fix Before Next Release)
2. **Hardcoded API key** (config.py:15)
   - Impact: Credential exposure in version control
   - Effort: 15 minutes
   - Fix: Move to environment variable

### 🟠 Medium Priority (Plan for Next Sprint)
3. **Weak password requirements** (auth.py:89)
   - Impact: Brute force vulnerability
   - Effort: 2 hours
   - Fix: Implement password policy

### 🟢 Low Priority (Backlog)
4. **Missing security headers** (server.py:12)
   - Impact: Defense-in-depth improvement
   - Effort: 30 minutes
   - Fix: Add security headers middleware
```

## Common Vulnerability Patterns

### 1. SQL Injection

```python
# 🔴 VULNERABLE
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
db.execute(query)

# ✅ SECURE
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
db.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

### 2. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

```python
# 🔴 VULNERABLE
html = f"<div>Welcome {user_input}</div>"

# ✅ SECURE
from markupsafe import escape
html = f"<div>Welcome {escape(user_input)}</div>"
```

### 3. Hardcoded Secrets

```python
# 🔴 VULNERABLE
API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123xyz"

# ✅ SECURE
import os
API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
if not API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("API_KEY environment variable required")
```

### 4. Insecure Deserialization

```python
# 🔴 VULNERABLE
import pickle
data = pickle.loads(untrusted_input)  # Code execution risk

# ✅ SECURE
import json
data = json.loads(untrusted_input)  # Safe for data
```

### 5. Path Traversal

```python
# 🔴 VULNERABLE
file_path = f"/uploads/{user_filename}"
with open(file_path) as f:  # user_filename could be "../../etc/passwd"

# ✅ SECURE
from pathlib import Path
base_dir = Path("/uploads")
file_path = (base_dir / user_filename).resolve()
if not file_path.is_relative_to(base_dir):
    raise ValueError("Invalid filename")
```

### 6. Weak Cryptography

```python
# 🔴 VULNERABLE
import hashlib
password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()

# ✅ SECURE
import bcrypt
password_hash = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())
```

### 7. Insecure Random

```python
# 🔴 VULNERABLE
import random
token = random.randint(1000, 9999)  # Predictable

# ✅ SECURE
import secrets
token = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)  # Cryptographically secure
```

## Dependency Security Analysis

### CVE Scanning

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip list --outdated  # or uv pip list --outdated
safety check  # or pip-audit
npm audit  # for Node.js
```

## Security Review Principles

### Severity Assessment

**Critical (🔴):**
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- SQL injection
- Exposed credentials
- Complete system compromise

**High (🟡):**
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Authorization flaws
- Sensitive data exposure
- Known CVEs in dependencies

**Medium (🟠):**
- Missing security headers
- Weak password policies
- Information disclosure
- Insecure defaults

**Low (🟢):**
- Security hardening opportunities
- Defense-in-depth improvements
- Monitoring enhancements

### False Positive Handling

- Distinguish real vulnerabilities from false alarms
- Consider context (dev vs production)
- Verify exploitability (not just theoretical)
- Provide evidence when flagging issues

### Practical Recommendations

- Specific, actionable fixes (not generic advice)
- Include code examples showing how to fix
- Estimate effort for each fix
- Prioritize by impact and exploitability

## When NOT to Flag as Vulnerability

**Development/Test Code:**
- Hardcoded test credentials in test files (if clearly marked)
- Debug logging in development mode (if disabled in production)
- Mock authentication in test environments

**Intentional Design:**
- Public APIs (if authentication not required by design)
- Open data (if meant to be publicly accessible)
- Rate limits (if use case doesn't need them)

Always consider context and ask if flagging uncertainty.

## Security Output Philosophy

### Be Helpful, Not Alarmist
- Clear severity levels
- Realistic impact assessment
- Practical, specific fixes
- Balance security with usability

### Fail Secure
- When in doubt, flag it
- Better false positive than missed vulnerability
- Explain reasoning for flagging

### Educate While Auditing
- Explain why something is vulnerable
- Teach security principles
- Reference authoritative sources (OWASP, CWE)

Remember: Security is not about perfection - it's about raising the cost of attack above the value of the target. Focus on high-impact vulnerabilities first, provide clear remediation paths, and ensure fixes don't introduce new issues.
