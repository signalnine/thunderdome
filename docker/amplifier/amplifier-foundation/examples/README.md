## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Bundles
Composable configuration units that produce mount plans for AmplifierSession. A bundle specifies which modules to load, how to configure them, and what instructions to provide.

```python
bundle = Bundle(
    name="my-agent",
    providers=[...],  # LLM backends
    tools=[...],      # Capabilities
    hooks=[...],      # Observability
    instruction="..." # System prompt
)
```

### Composition
Combine bundles to create customized agents. Later bundles override earlier ones, allowing progressive refinement.

```python
foundation = await load_bundle("foundation")
custom = Bundle(name="custom", tools=[...])
composed = foundation.compose(custom)  # custom overrides foundation
```

### Preparation
Download and activate all modules before execution. The `prepare()` method resolves module sources (git URLs, local paths) and makes them importable.

```python
prepared = await composed.prepare()  # Downloads modules if needed
session = await prepared.create_session()
```

### Module Sources
Specify where to download modules from. Every module needs a `source` field for `prepare()` to resolve it.

```python
tools=[
    {
        "module": "tool-filesystem",
        "source": "git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-module-tool-filesystem@main"
    }
]
```

### Tool Protocol
Custom tools implement a simple protocol - no inheritance required:

```python
class MyTool:
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my-tool"
    
    @property
    def description(self) -> str:
        return "What this tool does..."
    
    @property
    def input_schema(self) -> dict:
        return {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "param": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "required": ["param"]
        }
    
    async def execute(self, input: dict) -> ToolResult:
        return ToolResult(success=True, output="result")
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Hello World
The minimal Amplifier application:

```python
foundation = await load_bundle(foundation_path)
provider = await load_bundle(provider_path)
composed = foundation.compose(provider)
prepared = await composed.prepare()
session = await prepared.create_session()

async with session:
    response = await session.execute("Your prompt")
```

### Pattern: Adding Tools
Compose tools into your agent:

```python
tools = Bundle(
    name="tools",
    tools=[
        {"module": "tool-filesystem", "source": "git+https://..."},
        {"module": "tool-bash", "source": "git+https://..."},
    ]
)
composed = foundation.compose(provider).compose(tools)
```

### Pattern: Custom Tool
Register custom tools after session creation:

```python
# After session is created
await session.coordinator.mount("tools", MyTool(), name="my-tool")

# Then use in session
async with session:
    response = await session.execute("Use my custom tool")
```

### Pattern: Multi-Agent
Sequential agent workflow:

```python
# Agent 1: Design
architect = foundation.compose(provider).compose(architect_config)
prepared1 = await architect.prepare()
session1 = await prepared1.create_session()
async with session1:
    design = await session1.execute("Design the system")

# Agent 2: Implement (uses Agent 1 output)
implementer = foundation.compose(provider).compose(implementer_config)
prepared2 = await implementer.prepare()
session2 = await prepared2.create_session()
async with session2:
    code = await session2.execute(f"Implement: {design}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" Error
Modules need `source` fields so `prepare()` can download them:
```python
{"module": "tool-bash", "source": "git+https://..."}
```

### First Run Takes 30+ Seconds
This is normal - modules are downloaded from GitHub and cached in `~/.amplifier/cache/`. Subsequent runs are fast.

### "API key error"
Set your provider's API key:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'
# or
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

### Path Issues
Examples assume you're running from the `amplifier-foundation` directory:
```bash
cd amplifier-foundation
uv run python examples/XX_example.py
```

If path errors occur, check that `Path(__file__).parent.parent` resolves to the amplifier-foundation directory.

## Architecture Principles

### Composition Over Configuration
Amplifier favors swapping modules over toggling flags. Want streaming? Use `orchestrator: loop-streaming`. Want different tools? Compose a different tool bundle. No complex configuration matrices.

### Protocol-Based
Tools, providers, hooks, and orchestrators implement protocols (duck typing), not base classes. No framework inheritance required - just implement the interface.

### Explicit Sources
Module sources are explicit in configuration. No implicit discovery or magic imports. If you need a module, specify where it comes from: git repository, local path, or package name.

### Preparation Phase
Modules are resolved and downloaded before execution (`prepare()`), not during runtime. This ensures deterministic behavior and clear error messages.
