Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## Session Recovery\n\n**At the start of every brainstorming session**, check for incomplete checkpoints:\n\n```bash\nls docs/plans/.brainstorm-checkpoint-*.json 2>/dev/null | head -1\n```\n\nIf checkpoint exists and is less than 24 hours old:\n\n```\nFound incomplete brainstorming session from [time ago]:\nTopic: \"[topic from checkpoint]\"\nProgress: [N] questions answered ([mode] mode)\n\nOptions:\n1. Resume from checkpoint\n2. Start fresh (discards previous progress)\n```\n\nOn resume:\n- Load decisions from checkpoint JSON\n- Summarize: \"Resuming. Decisions so far: [list key decisions]...\"\n- Continue from where session left off\n\nIf no checkpoint or user chooses fresh start, proceed to The Process.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Then offer mode selection (see below)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Mode Selection** (after checking project context):\n\n**If `CONCLAVE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`:** Skip mode selection, use Consensus Autopilot automatically. Announce: \"Non-interactive mode: using Consensus Autopilot.\"\n\nOtherwise, present the choice:\n\n```\nI'll help design this feature. Two modes available:\n\n1. **Interactive** - I ask questions, you answer, we iterate together\n2. **Consensus Autopilot** - Multi-agent consensus (Claude, Gemini, Codex)\n   answers design questions. You watch decisions narrate and can interrupt\n   anytime to override.\n\nNote: Autopilot calls consensus for each question (~30-60 seconds each).\nFull design typically takes 5-10 minutes.\n\nWhich mode?\n```\n\n- If **Interactive**: Proceed with normal question flow (one at a time, user answers)\n- If **Autopilot**: See \"Autopilot Mode\" section below\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## Autopilot Mode\n\nWhen user selects autopilot, announce: \"Starting autopilot. I'll narrate each decision. Jump in anytime to override.\"\n\n**For each design question:**\n\n1. **Format the question for consensus:**\n   ```\n   Design decision needed: [question]\n\n   Context: [what we're building, decisions made so far]\n\n   Options I'm considering:\n   - Option A: [description]\n   - Option B: [description]\n   - Option C: [description]\n\n   You may suggest alternatives. Recommend one option with brief reasoning.\n   ```\n\n2. **Call consensus:**\n   ```bash\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"$FORMATTED_QUESTION\" \\\n     --context=\"$PROJECT_CONTEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Narrate the result:**\n   ```\n   Q: What database technology?\n   → Consensus recommends: PostgreSQL\n     Reasoning: \"Relational model fits the entity relationships,\n     ACID compliance needed for financial data, team has experience.\"\n\n   Proceeding...\n   ```\n\n4. **Save checkpoint** (see Checkpoint Saving below)\n\n5. **Continue to next question** - if user sends any message, that's an interrupt\n\n**Error Handling:**\n\nIf consensus fails (timeout, API errors, <2 agents respond):\n```\nConsensus unavailable for this question. Falling back to interactive:\n\nQ: What database technology?\nOptions:\n1. PostgreSQL - relational, ACID compliant\n2. MongoDB - document store, flexible schema\n3. SQLite - embedded, simple\n\nYour choice?\n```\nAfter user answers, offer: \"Resume autopilot for remaining questions, or stay interactive?\"\n\nIf consensus returns split decision (no clear winner):\n```\nConsensus split on this question:\n- Claude recommends PostgreSQL (relational model fits)\n- Gemini recommends MongoDB (schema flexibility)\n- Codex recommends PostgreSQL (team experience)\n\nNo strong consensus. Your call - which direction?\n```\nThen resume autopilot after user decides.\n\n## Interrupt Handling\n\nWhen user sends any message during autopilot:\n\n1. **Pause immediately** and acknowledge\n\n2. **Present options:**\n   ```\n   Paused. What would you like to change?\n\n   Last decision: [question → answer]\n\n   Options:\n   - Override this decision (tell me your preference)\n   - Go back further (redo earlier decisions)\n   - Switch to interactive mode (take over from here)\n   - Resume autopilot (continue as-is)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handle response:**\n   - **Override**: Record user's choice, resume autopilot from next question\n   - **Go back**: Show recent decisions, let user pick restart point, then re-run ALL subsequent questions with fresh consensus (don't reuse old answers)\n   - **Switch to interactive**: Continue with normal Q&A flow\n   - **Resume**: Continue where paused\n\n4. **On resume:**\n   ```\n   Resuming autopilot with your override: [change made]\n\n   Next question...\n   ```\n\n## Checkpoint Saving\n\n**After each decision** (in either mode), save state:\n\n```bash\n# Checkpoint file path\nCHECKPOINT=\"docs/plans/.brainstorm-checkpoint-$(date +%Y%m%d).json\"\n```\n\nCheckpoint JSON structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"topic\": \"user authentication feature\",\n  \"mode\": \"autopilot\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-01-18T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-18T10:35:00Z\",\n  \"decisions\": [\n    {\"q\": \"Target users?\", \"answer\": \"B2B enterprise\", \"source\": \"consensus\"},\n    {\"q\": \"Database?\", \"answer\": \"PostgreSQL\", \"source\": \"user\"}\n  ],\n  \"current_phase\": \"questions\",\n  \"project_context\": \"summary of what we're building\"\n}\n```\n\nWrite checkpoint after each decision using the Write tool.\n\n**Cleanup:** Delete checkpoint file when design is complete and saved to final document.\n\n## Context Management\n\n**Compact at phase transitions** to preserve context for later phases:\n\n- **Before design presentation** (after all questions answered): Run `/compact` with decisions summary:\n  ```\n  /compact Brainstorming [topic]. Decisions made: [list key decisions]. Mode: [interactive/autopilot]. Ready to present design.\n  ```\n- **Before consensus validation** (after design written): Run `/compact` with design file reference:\n  ```\n  /compact Design written to [file path]. Ready for multi-agent validation.\n  ```\n- **Before implementation handoff** (after validation): Run `/compact` with final state:\n  ```\n  /compact Design validated. File: [path]. Ready for implementation setup.\n  ```\n\n**Why:** Brainstorming accumulates substantial context from questions, consensus calls, and design iterations. Compacting before validation ensures the consensus agents get clean, focused context.\n\n## After the Design\n\n**For Autopilot Mode - Summarize Decisions:**\n```\nDesign complete. Consensus made [N] decisions:\n\n- Database: PostgreSQL (consensus)\n- API style: REST (consensus)\n- Frontend: React (you overrode → Vue)\n- Auth: JWT (consensus)\n...\n\nReview the full design below, then we'll run final validation.\n```\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n- **Delete checkpoint file** after successful save\n\n**Multi-Agent Design Validation (Recommended):**\n\nAfter the user validates the complete design, run multi-agent review:\n\n\"Running multi-agent validation. Claude, Gemini, and Codex will review for architectural flaws, over-engineering, and missing requirements...\"\n\n**Always run unless user explicitly skips:**\n1. Prepare validation prompt:\n   ```\n   Review this software design for issues. Find architectural flaws, missing\n   requirements, over-engineering, maintainability concerns, testing gaps, or\n   any other problems. Rate each issue as:\n   STRONG (critical flaw), MODERATE (should address), WEAK (minor concern)\n   ```\n\n2. Invoke consensus:\n   ```bash\n   DESIGN_TEXT=$(cat \"docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md\")\n\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"Review this software design...\" \\\n     --context=\"$DESIGN_TEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. Present results:\n   - **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found X critical concerns. Recommend addressing before implementation.\"\n   - **Medium Priority**: \"Y moderate concerns identified. Review recommended.\"\n   - **Consider only**: \"Design validated. Z minor suggestions noted.\"\n\n4. Handle response:\n   - High Priority issues → Revise design, re-run consensus\n   - User accepts concerns → Proceed to Implementation\n   - User wants details → Show full consensus breakdown from `/tmp/consensus-*.md`\n\n5. **For Autopilot Mode - Flag self-disagreement:**\n   If validation consensus disagrees with a decision made during autopilot:\n   ```\n   Interesting: Validation consensus questions the PostgreSQL choice\n   made earlier.

Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.\n\nAssume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.\n\n**Announce at start:** \"I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan.\"\n\n**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).\n\n**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`\n\n## Bite-Sized Task Granularity\n\n**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**\n- \"Write the failing test\" - step\n- \"Run it to make sure it fails\" - step\n- \"Implement the minimal code to make the test pass\" - step\n- \"Run the tests and make sure they pass\" - step\n- \"Commit\" - step\n\n## Plan Document Header\n\n**Every plan MUST start with this header:**\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan\n\n> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use conclave:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.\n\n**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]\n\n**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]\n\n**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]\n\n---\n```\n\n## Task Structure\n\n```markdown\n### Task N: [Component Name]\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`\n- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`\n- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`\n\n**Dependencies:** [Task N, Task M] or none\n\n**Step 1: Write the failing test**\n\n```python\ndef test_specific_behavior():\n    result = function(input)\n    assert result == expected\n```\n\n**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**\n\nRun: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`\nExpected: FAIL with \"function not defined\"\n\n**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**\n\n```python\ndef function(input):\n    return expected\n```\n\n**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**\n\nRun: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`\nExpected: PASS\n\n**Step 5: Commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py\ngit commit -m \"feat: add specific feature\"\n```\n```\n\n## Remember\n- Exact file paths always\n- Complete code in plan (not \"add validation\")\n- Exact commands with expected output\n- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax\n- Include Dependencies field for every task (required for parallel execution)\n- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits\n\n## Context Management\n\n**Compact before validation** — plan writing involves extensive codebase exploration:\n\n```\n/compact Plan written to [file path]. [N] tasks, [M] waves. Ready for consensus validation.\n```\n\n**Why:** Writing a plan requires reading many files, understanding architecture, and drafting detailed task specs. Compacting before validation ensures the consensus call and execution handoff have clean context.\n\n## Plan Validation with Multi-Agent Consensus\n\n**Before offering execution options**, validate the plan with multi-agent consensus:\n\n```bash\nPLAN_FILE=\"docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\"\nPLAN_TEXT=$(cat \"$PLAN_FILE\")\n\nconclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n  --prompt=\"Review this implementation plan for: 1) Architectural soundness - is the approach appropriate? 2) Risk assessment - what could go wrong? 3) Scope validation - is this over/under-engineered? 4) Missing steps - are there gaps in the plan? Rate each concern as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority.\" \\\n  --context=\"$PLAN_TEXT\"\n```\n\n**Present results to user:**\n- **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found architectural concerns. Recommend addressing before implementation.\"\n- **Medium Priority**: \"Some concerns raised. Would you like to review them?\"\n- **Low/None**: \"Plan validated by multi-agent review. Ready for execution.\"\n\n**Handle response:**\n- If High Priority issues → Revise plan, re-run consensus\n- If user accepts concerns → Proceed to Execution Handoff\n- If user wants to skip → Proceed (their choice)\n\n## Execution Handoff\n\n**If `CONCLAVE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`:** Skip the choice, use Subagent-Driven automatically. Announce: \"Non-interactive mode: using subagent-driven execution.\"\n\nOtherwise, offer execution choice:\n\n**\"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**\n\n**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration\n\n**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints\n\n**Which approach?\"**\n\n**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**\n- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use conclave:subagent-driven-development\n- Stay in this session\n- Fresh subagent per task + code review\n\n**If Parallel Session chosen:**\n- Guide them to open new session in worktree\n- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** New session uses conclave:executing-plans\n\n\nARGUMENTS: Implement SQLite FTS5 full-text search for Express note-taking API.

Tasks done: [list]. Tasks remaining: [list]. Current branch state: [summary]. Next wave: [tasks].\n  ```\n- **Before final consensus review**: Run `/compact` with focus on what was built:\n  ```\n  /compact All waves complete. Implemented: [summary of all tasks]. Ready for consensus review.\n  ```\n- **Before finishing-a-development-branch**: Run `/compact` with focus on merge readiness:\n  ```\n  /compact Implementation complete. [N] tasks done, [M] failed. Ready for branch completion.\n  ```\n\n**Why:** Each wave generates substantial output from task agents, merge operations, and conflict resolution. Without compaction, later waves run in degraded context.\n\n## Task Execution\n\n### Parallel Execution (default)\n\nRun all tasks through `conclave parallel-run`:\n\n```bash\n./skills/subagent-driven-development/conclave parallel-run \\\n    docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md \\\n    --max-concurrent 3 \\\n    --non-interactive\n```\n\nThe orchestrator handles everything automatically:\n1. **Parse plan** - Extracts tasks, dependencies, files\n2. **Compute waves** - Groups tasks by dependency depth\n3. **Execute waves** - Per wave:\n   - Creates git worktree per task (from merged state of prior waves)\n   - Launches `conclave ralph-run --worktree` in each worktree in parallel\n   - Polls for completion\n   - Squash-merges completed tasks in plan order\n   - Re-runs tasks on merge conflicts (up to `PARALLEL_MAX_CONFLICT_RERUNS`)\n4. **Consensus review** - Runs `conclave auto-review` on all merged changes\n5. **Cleanup** - Removes worktrees, prints summary\n\n### Dry Run (preview schedule)\n\n```bash\n./skills/subagent-driven-development/conclave parallel-run \\\n    docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md \\\n    --dry-run\n```\n\n### Sequential Fallback\n\nFor tightly-coupled tasks or debugging, run tasks one at a time:\n\n```bash\nTASK_SPEC=$(mktemp --suffix=.md)\n# Write task spec...\n./skills/ralph-loop/conclave ralph-run \"task-name\" \"$TASK_SPEC\" --non-interactive -d \"$(pwd)\"\n```\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```\n========================================\nParallel Runner\nPlan: docs/plans/feature-plan.md\nMax concurrent: 3\nBase branch: feature/my-feature\n========================================\n\n--- Phase 1: Parsing Plan ---\nTasks found: 5\nWaves: 3\n  Wave 0: tasks 1 2 3\n  Wave 1: tasks 4\n  Wave 2: tasks 5\n\n--- Phase 2: Setup ---\n\n--- Phase 3: Executing Waves ---\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nWave 0\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n[WAVE 0] Launching Task 1: Create utilities\n[WAVE 0] Launching Task 2: Build core module\n[WAVE 0] Launching Task 3: Add config parser\n[WAVE 0] Task 1 COMPLETED\n[WAVE 0] Task 2 COMPLETED\n[WAVE 0] Task 3 FAILED (exit 1)\n\n[WAVE 0] Merging completed tasks...\n[MERGE] Squash-merging task/1-create-utilities...\n[MERGE] Successfully merged task/1-create-utilities\n[MERGE] Squash-merging task/2-build-core-module...\n[MERGE] Successfully merged task/2-build-core-module\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nWave 1\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n[WAVE 1] Launching Task 4: Integration layer\n[WAVE 1] Task 4 COMPLETED\n\n[WAVE 1] Merging completed tasks...\n[MERGE] Successfully merged task/4-integration-layer\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nWave 2\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n[WAVE 2] Launching Task 5: CLI entry point\n[WAVE 2] Task 5 COMPLETED\n\n--- Phase 4: Consensus Review ---\nRunning consensus review on all merged changes...\n\n--- Cleanup ---\n\n========================================\nPARALLEL EXECUTION SUMMARY\n========================================\n  Completed: 4/5\n  Failed:    1\n  Skipped:   0\n========================================\n  Task 3 (Add config parser): FAILED -

+# Full-Text Search (FTS5) Implementation Plan
+
+> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use conclave:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.
+
+**Goal:** Add FTS5-powered full-text search with BM25 ranking, snippet highlighting, autocomplete suggestions, and CRUD sync to the existing note-taking API.
+
+**Architecture:** Create an FTS5 virtual table (`notes_fts`) mirroring `notes.title` and `notes.body`. Use `content=notes` with `content_rowid=id` for an external-content FTS table that references the main `notes` table. Sync via SQLite triggers on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE. Add two new route handlers for search and suggest.
+
+**Tech Stack:** SQLite FTS5, better-sqlite3, Express, TypeScript
+
+---
+
+### Task 1: Add FTS5 virtual table and triggers to database setup
+
+**Files:**
+- Modify: `src/db.ts:9-19` (add FTS table and triggers after notes table creation)
+
+**Dependencies:** none
+
+**Step 1: Add FTS5 virtual table creation after notes table**
+
+After the existing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes` block (line 19), add:
+
+```sql
+CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes_fts USING fts5(
+  title,
+  body,
+  content=notes,
+  content_rowid=id
+);
+```
+
+**Step 2: Add triggers for FTS sync**
+
+Add three triggers after the FTS table creation:
+
+```sql
+-- Trigger: after inserting a note, insert into FTS
+CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_ai AFTER INSERT ON notes BEGIN
+  INSERT INTO notes_fts(rowid, title, body) VALUES (new.id, new.title, new.body);
+END;
+
+-- Trigger: after deleting a note, remove from FTS
+CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_ad AFTER DELETE ON notes BEGIN
+  INSERT INTO notes_fts(notes_fts, rowid, title, body) VALUES('delete', old.id, old.title, old.body);
+END;
+
+-- Trigger: after updating a note, remove old + insert new into FTS
+CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_au AFTER UPDATE ON notes BEGIN
+  INSERT INTO notes_fts(notes_fts, rowid, title, body) VALUES('delete', old.id, old.title, old.body);
+  INSERT INTO notes_fts(rowid, title, body) VALUES (new.id, new.title, new.body);
+END;
+```
+
+**Step 3: Rebuild FTS index in seedDatabase**
+
+In the `seedDatabase` function (after line 37 `insertMany(notes)`), add a rebuild so existing seed data is indexed:
+
+```typescript
+db.exec("INSERT INTO notes_fts(notes_fts) VALUES('rebuild')");
+```
+
+---
+
+### Task 2: Add search endpoint `GET /notes/search?q=<query>`
+
+**Files:**
+- Modify: `src/routes.ts:1-4` (add SearchResult import)
+- Modify: `src/routes.ts:7-8` (add search route before existing `/notes` routes)
+
+**Dependencies:** Task 1
+
+**Step 1: Add SearchResult import**
+
+Update line 3 of `src/routes.ts`:
+```typescript
+import { Note, NoteInput, SearchResult } from './models.js';
+```
+
+**Step 2: Add search route handler**
+
+Add the search route BEFORE the `GET /notes/:id` route (before line 35) to prevent Express matching `search` as an `:id` parameter. Insert after line 8 (after `const router = Router();`):
+
+```typescript
+// GET /notes/search - Full-text search
+router.get('/notes/search', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
+  try {
+    const q = req.query.q as string | undefined;
+    if (!q || q.trim() === '') {
+      throw new ValidationError('Search query is required');
+    }
+
+    const page = Math.max(1, parseInt(req.query.page as string) || 1);
+    const perPage = 20;
+    const offset = (page - 1) * perPage;
+
+    // Sanitize the query for FTS5: strip characters that are FTS5 operators
+    const sanitized = q.replace(/[^\w\s"]/g, ' ').trim();
+    if (sanitized === '') {
+      res.json({ results: [], total: 0, page, perPage });
+      return;
+    }
+
+    // Count total matches
+    const countStmt = db.prepare(`
+      SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM notes_fts WHERE notes_fts MATCH ?
+    `);
+
+    let total: number;
+    try {
+      total = (countStmt.get(sanitized) as { total: number }).total;
+    } catch {
+      // If FTS query syntax is invalid, return empty results
+      res.json({ results: [], total: 0, page, perPage });
+      return;
+    }
+
+    // Search with BM25 ranking and snippet highlighting
+    const searchStmt = db.prepare(`
+      SELECT
+        notes.id,
+        notes.title,
+        snippet(notes_fts, 1, '<mark>', '</mark>', '...', 32) as snippet,
+        bm25(notes_fts) as rank
+      FROM notes_fts
+      JOIN notes ON notes.id = notes_fts.rowid
+      WHERE notes_fts MATCH ?
+      ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)
+      LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
+    `);
+
+    const results = searchStmt.all(sanitized, perPage, offset) as SearchResult[];
+
+    res.json({ results, total, page, perPage });
+  } catch (err) {
+    next(err);
+  }
+});
+```
+
+Key design decisions:
+- `bm25()` returns negative values where more negative = more relevant, so `ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)` gives ascending (most relevant first)
+- `snippet()` with column index 1 (body) wraps matches in `<mark>` tags
+- Special characters are stripped to prevent FTS5 syntax errors
+- Quoted phrases are preserved (the `"` character is kept by the regex)
+
+---
+
+### Task 3: Add suggest endpoint `GET /notes/search/suggest?q=<prefix>`
+
+**Files:**
+- Modify: `src/routes.ts` (add suggest route after search route)
+
+**Dependencies:** Task 1
+
+**Step 1: Add suggest route handler**
+
+Add this route right after the search route (and before `GET /notes/:id`):
+
+```typescript
+// GET /notes/search/suggest - Autocomplete suggestions
+router.get('/notes/search/suggest', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
+  try {
+    const q = req.query.q as string | undefined;
+    if (!q || q.trim() === '') {
+      throw new ValidationError('Search query is required');
+    }
+
+    // Sanitize and create prefix query
+    const sanitized = q.replace(/[^\w\s]/g, ' ').trim();
+    if (sanitized === '') {
+      res.json({ results: [] });
+      return;
+    }
+
+    // Use prefix matching with * operator
+    const prefixQuery = sanitized.split(/\s+/).map(t => t + '*').join(' ');
+
+    const suggestStmt = db.prepare(`
+      SELECT notes.id, notes.title
+      FROM notes_fts
+      JOIN notes ON notes.id = notes_fts.rowid
+      WHERE notes_fts MATCH ?
+      ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)
+      LIMIT 5
+    `);
+
+    let results;
+    try {
+      results = suggestStmt.all(prefixQuery);
+    } catch {
+      results = [];
+    }
+
+    res.json({ results });
+  } catch (err) {
+    next(err);
+  }
+});
+```
+
+Key design decisions:
+- Prefix matching: append `*` to each word for FTS5 prefix queries
+- Limited to 5 results as per requirements
+- Ranked by BM25 relevance
+
+---
+
+### Task 4: Run tests and verify all 35 pass
+
+**Files:** none (verification only)
+
+**Dependencies:** Tasks 1, 2, 3
+
+**Step 1: Run the full test suite**
+
+```bash
+npm test
+```
+
+Expected: All 35 tests pass (15 CRUD + 20 search).
+
+**Step 2: If any test fails, analyze and fix**
+
+Common issues to watch for:
+- Route ordering: `/notes/search` must be registered before `/notes/:id`
+- FTS5 snippet column index: 0=title, 1=body
+- BM25 ordering direction
+- Special character handling in FTS queries
