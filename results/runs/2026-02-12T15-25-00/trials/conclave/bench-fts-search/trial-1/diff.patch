All 35 tests are passing (15 existing CRUD tests + 20 search tests). Let me provide a summary of what was implemented:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the full-text search feature for the note-taking API using SQLite FTS5. Here's what was added:\n\n### 1. **Database Changes** (`src/db.ts`)\n- Created an FTS5 virtual table `notes_fts` for full-text search on `title` and `body` fields\n- Added three triggers to keep the FTS index synchronized:\n  - `notes_ai`: After INSERT - adds new notes to the FTS index\n  - `notes_au`: After UPDATE - updates the FTS index with new content\n  - `notes_ad`: After DELETE - removes deleted notes from the FTS index\n\n### 2. **Search Endpoint** (`GET /notes/search`)\n- Full-text search across note titles and bodies using FTS5 MATCH operator\n- BM25 ranking for relevance (ORDER BY rank)\n- Snippet extraction with `<mark>` tags highlighting matched terms\n- Pagination support (20 results per page, controlled by `?page=N`)\n- Returns: `{ results: SearchResult[], total: number, page: number, perPage: number }`\n- Handles special characters gracefully by escaping them when needed\n- Returns 400 for missing/empty query parameter\n\n### 3. **Suggest Endpoint** (`GET /notes/search/suggest`)\n- Autocomplete functionality using prefix queries (`query*`)\n- Returns up to 5 matching note titles\n- Returns: `{ results: SuggestResult[] }`\n- Returns 400 for missing/empty query parameter\n\n### 4. **Error Handling**\n- Added robust handling for FTS5 syntax errors from special characters\n- Returns empty results instead of crashing when FTS5 encounters invalid syntax\n- Maintains proper validation for missing/empty query parameters\n\n### Test Results\n✅ All 35 tests passing:\n- 15 existing CRUD tests (continue to work correctly)\n- 20 new search tests (all features working as specified)\n\nThe implementation meets all requirements including full-text search with BM25 ranking, snippet highlighting, phrase queries, pagination, autocomplete suggestions, and proper FTS index synchronization."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":262,"cache_read_input_tokens":53409,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":262,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5a5b8913-ed1c-4eff-901c-2b5653a5760d","uuid":"8561d010-2714-4aea-906d-d8581f71f669"}
