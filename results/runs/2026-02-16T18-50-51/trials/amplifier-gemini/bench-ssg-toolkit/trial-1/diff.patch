+[2mMy Approach to Integrating Plugins into the SSG Toolkit     
+
+Okay, here's the deal: I'm tasked with integrating eight new
+plugins into this Static Site Generator toolkit. The user   
+has given me a specific implementation order, broken down   
+into Waves 1, 2, and 3, presumably because of dependency    
+chains. The core logic, including the fundamental types and 
+interfaces, resides within the src/core/ directory. There   
+are existing tests, tests/core.test.ts, and I'll need to    
+create new ones in tests/plugins/ to validate the plugin    
+behavior.                                                   
+
+My initial approach is systematic. I'm going to start by    
+diving deep into the codebase. I need to understand the     
+existing architecture, especially the Plugin interface and  
+how the core components are structured. The                 
+src/core/types.ts file will be crucial here. I'll leverage  
+the foundation:explorer to quickly map out the code and     
+internal relationships.                                     
+
+To keep myself on track, I'll put together a detailed todo  
+list outlining each of the eight plugins. I will then work  
+through each wave in order.                                 
+
+My Implementation plan is:                                  
+
+ 1 Code Exploration: Explore the core code, particularly    
+   src/core/types.ts and the overall directory structure, to
+   get a handle on the existing architecture.               
+ 2 Plugin To-Do List: Create a comprehensive to-do list for 
+   all eight plugins, to track my work efficiently.         
+ 3 Wave 1 Implementation: Begin by implementing the plugins 
+   in Wave 1.                                               
+ 4 Wave 2 Implementation: Move on to Wave 2 plugins.        
+ 5 Wave 3 Implementation: Complete the plugin integration   
+   with Wave 3.                                             
+ 6 Verification and Cleanup: Rigorously test each plugin    
+   against the expected behavior, and ensure everything     
+   adheres to the established linting standards.            
+
+Alright, let's get started. I'll fire up that explorer and  
+begin the code exploration.[0m

+    [2m[0m
+    [2m 1 Directory Listing: src/core/ and tests/plugins/: [0m
+    [2m   I'll start by listing the contents of src/core/  [0m
+    [2m   to ensure types.ts is where it's supposed to be. [0m
+    [2m   Simultaneously, I'll list the contents of        [0m
+    [2m   tests/plugins/ to see the test files and get a   [0m

+    [2m 2 Interface Inspection: src/core/types.ts: Now the [0m
+    [2m   core task: I'll carefully read the               [0m
+    [2m   src/core/types.ts file, paying close attention to[0m
+    [2m   the definition of the Plugin interface. I'll     [0m
+    [2m   extract all the relevant members, methods, and   [0m
+    [2m   any associated documentation, and make a mental  [0m
+    [2m   note of any dependencies or implications. I'll   [0m
+    [2m   also look for any comments that might offer      [0m
+    [2m   insights into the design rationale.              [0m
+    [2m 3 Test Analysis: tests/plugins/: Next, I'll examine[0m
+    [2m   the files in tests/plugins/. If the file names   [0m
+    [2m   are descriptive enough, I can probably determine [0m
+    [2m   the functionality of the plugins being tested. If[0m
+    [2m   not, I'll need to dig into the test code itself  [0m
+    [2m   to understand the test cases, setup, and         [0m
+    [2m   assertions. I'll be looking for patterns, test   [0m
+    [2m   fixtures, and any hints about how plugins should [0m

+    [2m 4 Implementation Check: src/plugins/ (if it        [0m
+    [2m   exists): I'll check if a src/plugins/ directory  [0m
+    [2m   exists and, if it does, list its contents. If    [0m
+    [2m   there are existing plugins, I'll look at the     [0m
+    [2m   implementations to see how they're structured    [0m
+    [2m   relative to the Plugin interface and the tests.  [0m
+    [2m   This will help clarify the overall design.       [0m
+    [2m 5 Synthesis and Summary: Finally, I'll synthesize  [0m
+    [2m   my findings into a concise summary that clearly  [0m
+    [2m   defines the Plugin interface and explains the    [0m
+    [2m   testing methodology. This summary will be        [0m
+    [2m   tailored for an expert audience, so I can skip   [0m
+    [2m   unnecessary explanations and focus on the most   [0m

+       
+       ### Overview
+       The system uses a hook-based plugin architecture defined in `src/core/types.ts`. Plugins can intervene at three stages of the build process: before build, during content transformation, and after build. Currently, the `src/plugins/` directory is empty, but a comprehensive test suite in `tests/plugins/` defines the expected behavior for 8 core plugins.

+[2mMy Approach to Building These SSG Plugins                   
+
+Alright, I've got the lay of the land. Eight plugins for    
+this SSG toolkit, following this prescribed wave structure –
+sounds straightforward. The core types and tests are in     
+place, which is excellent. I'll stick to the waves: Wave 1, 
+then 2, then 3.                                             
+
+First things first: I'm going to get my todo list set up.   
+Then, I'll dive into Wave 1. Before I write any code,       
+though, I need to get familiar with the existing foundation.
+I'll head straight into src/core/types.ts to fully          
+understand the Plugin interface definition. Understanding   
+this is absolutely crucial.                                 
+
+After that, I'm going to take a peek at the package.json    
+file. It's important to know what dependencies are already  
+available. No need to waste time or introduce unnecessary   
+complications by trying to install a library that's already 
+in place, or worse, use a library that's not available. I   
+want to leverage what's there – marked, prismjs, whatever   
+else might be useful. I'll also glance at a test file to get
+a feel for how the plugins are expected to be integrated and
+used. This initial investigation will save me time and set  
+me up for success. Then I'll start on my todo list.[0m

+    [2m[0m
+    [2mOkay, so I've already taken a look at               [0m
+    [2msrc/core/types.ts, package.json, and                [0m
+    [2mtests/plugins/markdown-ext.test.ts. Based on my     [0m
+    [2munderstanding, here's the rundown, keeping in mind  [0m
+    [2mmy role as a sub-agent focused on file operations:  [0m
+    [2m[0m
+    [2m 1 Operation Summary: I've performed the requested  [0m
+    [2m   read operations on the specified files to        [0m
+    [2m   understand the project's environment and         [0m
+    [2m   requirements, as the parent session requested.   [0m
+    [2m 2 Results: The following is a distilled summary of [0m
+    [2m   what I gathered from each file, to share with the[0m
+    [2m   parent agent so it can proceed with its overall  [0m
+    [2m   objective:                                       [0m
+    [2m    • src/core/types.ts: This file is crucial       [0m
+    [2m      because it defines the core data structures   [0m
+    [2m      and interfaces for the system. It lays out the[0m
+    [2m      Plugin, PluginHooks, BuildContext, and        [0m
+    [2m      ContentFile types. These are the building     [0m
+    [2m      blocks. I understand that the system is built [0m
+    [2m      around plugins that hook into a build process,[0m
+    [2m      handling content files within a specific      [0m
+    [2m      context.                                      [0m
+    [2m    • package.json: This gives me the context on    [0m
+    [2m      project dependencies. I see that the project  [0m
+    [2m      relies on the marked library, which likely    [0m
+    [2m      means it's involved in parsing or rendering   [0m
+    [2m      Markdown. The presence of express suggests a  [0m
+    [2m      web server is involved, possibly for serving  [0m
+    [2m      the output or running a development server.   [0m
+    [2m    • tests/plugins/markdown-ext.test.ts: This file [0m
+    [2m      highlights the intended behavior of the       [0m
+    [2m      markdown-ext plugin. It's really helpful      [0m
+    [2m      because it shows how the system expects to    [0m
+    [2m      handle Markdown extensions like footnotes and [0m
+    [2m      admonitions (:::note, :::warning, :::tip).    [0m
+    [2m      This gives me a clearer picture of the kind of[0m
+    [2m      Markdown parsing and transformation that is   [0m
+    [2m      expected.                                     [0m
