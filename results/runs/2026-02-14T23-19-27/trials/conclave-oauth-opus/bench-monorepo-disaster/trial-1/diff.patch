Quick patches mask underlying issues.\n\n**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.\n\n**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**\n\n## The Iron Law\n\n```\nNO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST\n```\n\nIf you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse for ANY technical issue:\n- Test failures\n- Bugs in production\n- Unexpected behavior\n- Performance problems\n- Build failures\n- Integration issues\n\n**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**\n- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)\n- \"Just one quick fix\" seems obvious\n- You've already tried multiple fixes\n- Previous fix didn't work\n- You don't fully understand the issue\n\n**Don't skip when:**\n- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)\n- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)\n- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)\n\n## The Four Phases\n\nYou MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.\n\n### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation\n\n**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**\n\n1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**\n   - Don't skip past errors or warnings\n   - They often contain the exact solution\n   - Read stack traces completely\n   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes\n\n2. **Reproduce Consistently**\n   - Can you trigger it reliably?\n   - What are the exact steps?\n   - Does it happen every time?\n   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess\n\n3. **Check Recent Changes**\n   - What changed that could cause this?\n   - Git diff, recent commits\n   - New dependencies, config changes\n   - Environmental differences\n\n4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**\n\n   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**\n\n   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**\n   ```\n   For EACH component boundary:\n     - Log what data enters component\n     - Log what data exits component\n     - Verify environment/config propagation\n     - Check state at each layer\n\n   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks\n   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component\n   THEN investigate that specific component\n   ```\n\n   **Example (multi-layer system):**\n   ```bash\n   # Layer 1: Workflow\n   echo \"=== Secrets available in workflow: ===\"\n   echo \"IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}\"\n\n   # Layer 2: Build script\n   echo \"=== Env vars in build script: ===\"\n   env | grep IDENTITY || echo \"IDENTITY not in environment\"\n\n   # Layer 3: Signing script\n   echo \"=== Keychain state: ===\"\n   security list-keychains\n   security find-identity -v\n\n   # Layer 4: Actual signing\n   codesign --sign \"$IDENTITY\" --verbose=4 \"$APP\"\n   ```\n\n   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)\n\n5. **Trace Data Flow**\n\n   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**\n\n   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.\n\n   **Quick version:**\n   - Where does bad value originate?\n   - What called this with bad value?\n   - Keep tracing up until you find the source\n   - Fix at source, not at symptom\n\n### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis\n\n**Find the pattern before fixing:**\n\n1. **Find Working Examples**\n   - Locate similar working code in same codebase\n   - What works that's similar to what's broken?\n\n2. **Compare Against References**\n   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY\n   - Don't skim - read every line\n   - Understand the pattern fully before applying\n\n3. **Identify Differences**\n   - What's different between working and broken?\n   - List every difference, however small\n   - Don't assume \"that can't matter\"\n\n4. **Understand Dependencies**\n   - What other components does this need?\n   - What settings, config, environment?\n   - What assumptions does it make?\n\n### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing\n\n**Scientific method:**\n\n1. **Form Single Hypothesis**\n   - State clearly: \"I think X is the root cause because Y\"\n   - Write it down\n   - Be specific, not vague\n\n2. **Test Minimally**\n   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis\n   - One variable at a time\n   - Don't fix multiple things at once\n\n3. **Verify Before Continuing**\n   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4\n   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis\n   - DON'T add more fixes on top\n\n4. **When You Don't Know**\n   - Say \"I don't understand X\"\n   - Don't pretend to know\n   - Ask for help\n   - Research more\n\n### Multi-Agent Consensus Validation (Recommended)\n\nBefore implementing fix, validate root cause with multiple agents.\n\n**When to use:**\n- Complex bugs with unclear root cause\n- Multiple possible explanations\n- High-risk fixes (production, critical systems)\n- Want validation before committing time to fix\n\n**When to skip:**\n- Obvious bugs (typos, simple logic errors)\n- Time-critical emergencies (but consider after fix)\n- Root cause has strong evidence and single explanation\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Agent extracts context** from debugging session:\n   ```\n   ## Error Description\n   <User's initial bug report and symptoms>\n\n   ## Evidence Collected\n   <Stack traces, reproduction steps, logs analyzed>\n\n   ## Root Cause Hypothesis\n   <Current theory with reasoning>\n\n   ## Proposed Fix\n   <High-level fix approach>\n   ```\n\n2. **Invoke consensus:**\n   ```bash\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"Review this root cause analysis. Does the hypothesis explain all observed symptoms? Are there alternative explanations we should consider? Are there gaps in the evidence? Rate your confidence in this diagnosis as STRONG/MODERATE/WEAK.\" \\\n     --context=\"$DEBUGGING_CONTEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Display consensus results:**\n   - **High confidence**: \"All/most reviewers agree. Proceed with fix.\"\n   - **Medium confidence**: \"Moderate confidence. Concerns: <summary>. Proceed with caution.\"\n   - **Low confidence**: \"Low confidence. Reviewers suggest: <alternatives>. Type 'override' to proceed or 'investigate' to gather more evidence.\"\n\n4. **Handle response:**\n   - High/medium → Continue to Phase 4\n   - Low + 'override' → Continue with warning\n   - Low + 'investigate' → Return to Phase 1 for more evidence\n\n**Output:** Detailed breakdown saved to `/tmp/consensus-XXXXXX.md`\n\n**Example:**\n\n```\nPhase 3 complete. Root cause hypothesis: Off-by-one error in loop initialization.\n\nGet multi-agent consensus on root cause? (recommended) [y/n]: y\n\nRunning consensus (3 agents)...\nStage 1: 3/3 reviewers responded\nStage 2: Chairman synthesis complete\n\nConsensus: High confidence in root cause. All reviewers agree.\n- Claude: \"Hypothesis explains symptoms, evidence supports conclusion\"\n- Gemini: \"Loop start value of 1 vs 0 matches off-by-one pattern\"\n- Codex: \"Strong evidence, no alternative explanations apparent\"\n\nProceed to Phase 4: Implementation\n```\n\n### Context Management\n\n**Compact before implementation** if investigation was lengthy:\n\n```\n/compact Debugging [issue]. Root cause: [hypothesis]. Evidence: [key findings]. Consensus: [confidence level]. Ready to implement fix.\n```\n\n**Why:** Investigation phases generate extensive output from error traces, code reading, and consensus calls. Compacting before the fix ensures implementation has focused context on the confirmed root cause rather than discarded hypotheses.\n\n### Phase 4: Implementation\n\n**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**\n\n1. **Create Failing Test Case**\n   - Simplest possible reproduction\n   - Automated test if possible\n   - One-off test script if no framework\n   - MUST have before fixing\n   - Use the `conclave:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests\n\n2. **Implement Single Fix**\n   - Address the root cause identified\n   - ONE change at a time\n   - No \"while I'm here\" improvements\n   - No bundled refactoring\n\n3. **Verify Fix**\n   - Test passes now?\n   - No other tests broken?\n   - Issue actually resolved?\n\n4. **If Fix Doesn't Work**\n   - STOP\n   - Count: How many fixes have you tried?\n   - If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information\n   - **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**\n   - DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion\n\n5. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**\n\n   **Pattern indicating architectural problem:**\n   - Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place\n   - Fixes require \"massive refactoring\" to implement\n   - Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere\n\n   **STOP and question fundamentals:**\n   - Is this pattern fundamentally sound?\n   - Are we \"sticking with it through sheer inertia\"?\n   - Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?\n\n   **Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**\n\n   This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.\n\n## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process\n\nIf you catch yourself thinking:\n- \"Quick fix for now, investigate later\"\n- \"Just try changing X and see if it works\"\n- \"Add multiple changes, run tests\"\n- \"Skip the test, I'll manually verify\"\n- \"It's probably X, let me fix that\"\n- \"I don't fully understand but this might work\"\n- \"Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently\"\n- \"Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]\"\n- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow\n- **\"One more fix attempt\" (when already tried 2+)**\n- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**\n\n**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**\n\n**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4.5)\n\n## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong\n\n**Watch for these redirections:**\n- \"Is that not happening?\" - You assumed without verifying\n- \"Will it show us...?\" - You should have added evidence gathering\n- \"Stop guessing\" - You're proposing fixes without understanding\n- \"Ultrathink this\" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms\n- \"We're stuck?\" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working\n\n**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.\n\n## Common Rationalizations\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Issue is simple, don't need process\" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |\n| \"Emergency, no time for process\" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |\n| \"Just try this first, then investigate\" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |\n| \"I'll write test after confirming fix works\" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |\n| \"Multiple fixes at once saves time\" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |\n| \"Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern\" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |\n| \"I see the problem, let me fix it\" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |\n| \"One more fix attempt\" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |\n|-------|---------------|------------------|\n| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |\n| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |\n| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |\n| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |\n\n## When Process Reveals \"No Root Cause\"\n\nIf systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:\n\n1. You've completed the process\n2. Document what you investigated\n3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)\n4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation\n\n**But:** 95% of \"no root cause\" cases are incomplete investigation.\n\n## Supporting Techniques\n\nThese techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:\n\n- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** - Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger\n- **`defense-in-depth.md`** - Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause\n- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** - Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling\n\n**Related skills:**\n- **conclave:test-driven-development** - For creating failing test case (Phase 4, Step 1)\n- **conclave:verification-before-completion** - Verify fix worked before claiming success\n\n**Consensus tools:**\n- **conclave consensus** - Multi-agent root cause validation\n- **conclave auto-review** - Auto-detect SHAs for code review after fix\n\n## Real-World Impact\n\nFrom debugging sessions:\n- Systematic approach: 15-30 minutes to fix\n- Random fixes approach: 2-3 hours of thrashing\n- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%\n- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5959e130-0df5-450f-a849-65717d2428dd","uuid":"0657a7d6-92bb-44d3-9b6e-19682bd69eb6","isSynthetic":true}

`createUser` vs `registerUser`\n\n**Problem**: The function was renamed from `createUser` to `registerUser` in refactor, but not all call sites updated.\n\n**Exports from `/workspace/packages/core/src/index.ts`**:\n- Line 10: Exports `registerUser` (correct, new name)\n- Does NOT export `createUser` (missing!)\n\n**Call sites still using OLD name `createUser`**:\n1. `/workspace/packages/api/src/routes/users.ts:7` -

Version 3.19.0 doesn't have it.\n\n---\n\n### ISSUE #5: MERGE CONFLICT MARKERS\n\n**Location**: `/workspace/packages/api/tests/users.test.ts:14-28`\n\n```typescript\n<<<<<<< HEAD\n  it('creates user with valid data', async () => {\n    const res = await request(app)\n      .post('/users')\n      .set('x-user-role', 'admin')\n      .send({ name: 'Test', email: 'test@test.com' });\n    expect(res.status).toBe(201);\n=======\n  it('registers user with valid data', async () => {\n    const res = await request(app)\n      .post('/users')\n      .set('x-user-role', 'admin')\n      .send({ name: 'Test', email: 'test@test.com', role: 'user' });\n    expect(res.status).toBe(201);\n>>>>>>> refactor/user-system\n    expect(res.body.user.name).toBe('Test');\n  });\n```\n\n**Problem**: Unresolved merge conflict between:\n- `HEAD` (main branch): Creates user without role parameter\n- `refactor/user-system`: Registers user with role parameter included\n\nThe structural test at `/workspace/tests/structural.test.ts:60-76` checks for these markers and will fail.\n\n---\n\n### ISSUE #6: COMMITTED SECRETS\n\n**Location**: `/workspace/.env`\n\n```\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_PORT=5432\nDB_USER=admin\nDB_PASSWORD=super_secret_password_123\nDB_NAME=monorepo_db\n```\n\n**Problem**: \n- Contains plaintext database password: `super_secret_password_123`\n- Should not be committed to version control\n- The structural test at `/workspace/tests/structural.test.ts:78-99` checks for this and will fail\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY TABLE\n\n| Issue | Type | File | Severity | Status |\n|-------|------|------|----------|--------|\n| #1 | Circular Dependency | `packages/core/src/types.ts` ↔ `user.ts` | CRITICAL | Blocks build |\n| #2 | Missing Function Export | `packages/core/src/index.ts` | CRITICAL | Missing `createUser` |\n| #3 | Wrong Build Order | `tsconfig.json` | CRITICAL | Breaks `tsc -b` |\n| #4 | Old Dependency Version | `packages/core/package.json` | CRITICAL | `zod@3.19.0` too old |\n| #5 | Merge Conflict Markers | `packages/api/tests/users.test.ts` | CRITICAL | Fails structural test |\n| #6 | Committed Secrets | `.env` | CRITICAL | Fails structural test |\n\n---\n\n## WHAT WORKS\n\nAll other aspects of the codebase are well-structured:\n- TypeScript strict mode enabled in all packages\n- ESLint configuration is proper\n- Test structure is complete (35+ tests)\n- Workspace dependency declarations are correct\n- All source files are complete and well-documented\n- Permission RBAC system is properly implemented\n- Express API routes are properly structured\n- Job scheduler and background jobs are complete\n- Database abstraction layer works correctly\n\nThe six issues listed above are the only blockers preventing the monorepo from building, linting, and testing successfully."}],"totalDurationMs":58283,"totalTokens":42374,"totalToolUseCount":43,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":309,"cache_read_input_tokens":38524,"output_tokens":3541,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":309,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[]}}}

IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?\n2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)\n3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures\n4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?\n   - If NO: State actual status with evidence\n   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence\n5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim\n\nSkip any step = lying, not verifying\n```\n\n## Common Failures\n\n| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |\n|-------|----------|----------------|\n| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, \"should pass\" |\n| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |\n| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |\n| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |\n| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |\n| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports \"success\" |\n| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |\n\n## Red Flags - STOP\n\n- Using \"should\", \"probably\", \"seems to\"\n- Expressing satisfaction before verification (\"Great!\", \"Perfect!\", \"Done!\", etc.)\n- About to commit/push/PR without verification\n- Trusting agent success reports\n- Relying on partial verification\n- Thinking \"just this once\"\n- Tired and wanting work over\n- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**\n\n## Rationalization Prevention\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Should work now\" | RUN the verification |\n| \"I'm confident\" | Confidence ≠ evidence |\n| \"Just this once\" | No exceptions |\n| \"Linter passed\" | Linter ≠ compiler |\n| \"Agent said success\" | Verify independently |\n| \"I'm tired\" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |\n| \"Partial check is enough\" | Partial proves nothing |\n| \"Different words so rule doesn't apply\" | Spirit over letter |\n\n## Key Patterns\n\n**Tests:**\n```\n✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] \"All tests pass\"\n❌ \"Should pass now\" / \"Looks correct\"\n```\n\n**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**\n```\n✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)\n❌ \"I've written a regression test\" (without red-green verification)\n```\n\n**Build:**\n```\n✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] \"Build passes\"\n❌ \"Linter passed\" (linter doesn't check compilation)\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n```\n✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion\n❌ \"Tests pass, phase complete\"\n```\n\n**Agent delegation:**\n```\n✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state\n❌ Trust agent report\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nFrom 24 failure memories:\n- your human partner said \"I don't believe you\" - trust broken\n- Undefined functions shipped - would crash\n- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features\n- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework\n- Violates: \"Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced.\"\n\n## When To Apply\n\n**ALWAYS before:**\n- ANY variation of success/completion claims\n- ANY expression of satisfaction\n- ANY positive statement about work state\n- Committing, PR creation, task completion\n- Moving to next task\n- Delegating to agents\n\n**Rule applies to:**\n- Exact phrases\n- Paraphrases and synonyms\n- Implications of success\n- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness\n\n## Multi-Agent Final Verification (For Significant Work)\n\n**When to use:** Before claiming completion on significant features, bug fixes, or refactors.\n\n**When to skip:** Trivial changes, typos, single-line fixes.\n\nAfter local verification passes, run multi-agent consensus on the changes:\n\n```bash\n# Auto-detects base SHA, reviews all changes\nconclave auto-review \"Final verification: <description>\"\n```\n\n**Present results:**\n- **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found issues. Must address before claiming complete.\"\n- **Medium Priority**: \"Some concerns raised. Review before finalizing.\"\n- **Consider only**: \"Verified by local tests AND multi-agent review. Work complete.\"\n\n**This catches:**\n- Issues your tests don't cover\n- Patterns that look wrong to fresh eyes\n- Edge cases you didn't consider\n- Security or performance concerns\n\n**The enhanced gate function for significant work:**\n```\n1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?\n2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)\n3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures\n4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?\n5. CONSENSUS: Run multi-agent review on changes\n6. ONLY THEN: Make the claim\n```\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**No shortcuts for verification.**\n\nRun the command. Read the output. Get consensus on significant work. THEN claim the result.\n\nThis is non-negotiable.\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5959e130-0df5-450f-a849-65717d2428dd","uuid":"31d94687-fcb1-4fb2-9bda-9770271d7df0","isSynthetic":true}
