Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## Session Recovery\n\n**At the start of every brainstorming session**, check for incomplete checkpoints:\n\n```bash\nls docs/plans/.brainstorm-checkpoint-*.json 2>/dev/null | head -1\n```\n\nIf checkpoint exists and is less than 24 hours old:\n\n```\nFound incomplete brainstorming session from [time ago]:\nTopic: \"[topic from checkpoint]\"\nProgress: [N] questions answered ([mode] mode)\n\nOptions:\n1. Resume from checkpoint\n2. Start fresh (discards previous progress)\n```\n\nOn resume:\n- Load decisions from checkpoint JSON\n- Summarize: \"Resuming. Decisions so far: [list key decisions]...\"\n- Continue from where session left off\n\nIf no checkpoint or user chooses fresh start, proceed to The Process.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Then offer mode selection (see below)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Mode Selection** (after checking project context):\n\n**If `CONCLAVE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`:** Skip mode selection, use Consensus Autopilot automatically. Announce: \"Non-interactive mode: using Consensus Autopilot.\"\n\nOtherwise, present the choice:\n\n```\nI'll help design this feature. Two modes available:\n\n1. **Interactive** - I ask questions, you answer, we iterate together\n2. **Consensus Autopilot** - Multi-agent consensus (Claude, Gemini, Codex)\n   answers design questions. You watch decisions narrate and can interrupt\n   anytime to override.\n\nNote: Autopilot calls consensus for each question (~30-60 seconds each).\nFull design typically takes 5-10 minutes.\n\nWhich mode?\n```\n\n- If **Interactive**: Proceed with normal question flow (one at a time, user answers)\n- If **Autopilot**: See \"Autopilot Mode\" section below\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## Autopilot Mode\n\nWhen user selects autopilot, announce: \"Starting autopilot. I'll narrate each decision. Jump in anytime to override.\"\n\n**For each design question:**\n\n1. **Format the question for consensus:**\n   ```\n   Design decision needed: [question]\n\n   Context: [what we're building, decisions made so far]\n\n   Options I'm considering:\n   - Option A: [description]\n   - Option B: [description]\n   - Option C: [description]\n\n   You may suggest alternatives. Recommend one option with brief reasoning.\n   ```\n\n2. **Call consensus:**\n   ```bash\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"$FORMATTED_QUESTION\" \\\n     --context=\"$PROJECT_CONTEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Narrate the result:**\n   ```\n   Q: What database technology?\n   → Consensus recommends: PostgreSQL\n     Reasoning: \"Relational model fits the entity relationships,\n     ACID compliance needed for financial data, team has experience.\"\n\n   Proceeding...\n   ```\n\n4. **Save checkpoint** (see Checkpoint Saving below)\n\n5. **Continue to next question** - if user sends any message, that's an interrupt\n\n**Error Handling:**\n\nIf consensus fails (timeout, API errors, <2 agents respond):\n```\nConsensus unavailable for this question. Falling back to interactive:\n\nQ: What database technology?\nOptions:\n1. PostgreSQL - relational, ACID compliant\n2. MongoDB - document store, flexible schema\n3. SQLite - embedded, simple\n\nYour choice?\n```\nAfter user answers, offer: \"Resume autopilot for remaining questions, or stay interactive?\"\n\nIf consensus returns split decision (no clear winner):\n```\nConsensus split on this question:\n- Claude recommends PostgreSQL (relational model fits)\n- Gemini recommends MongoDB (schema flexibility)\n- Codex recommends PostgreSQL (team experience)\n\nNo strong consensus. Your call - which direction?\n```\nThen resume autopilot after user decides.\n\n## Interrupt Handling\n\nWhen user sends any message during autopilot:\n\n1. **Pause immediately** and acknowledge\n\n2. **Present options:**\n   ```\n   Paused. What would you like to change?\n\n   Last decision: [question → answer]\n\n   Options:\n   - Override this decision (tell me your preference)\n   - Go back further (redo earlier decisions)\n   - Switch to interactive mode (take over from here)\n   - Resume autopilot (continue as-is)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handle response:**\n   - **Override**: Record user's choice, resume autopilot from next question\n   - **Go back**: Show recent decisions, let user pick restart point, then re-run ALL subsequent questions with fresh consensus (don't reuse old answers)\n   - **Switch to interactive**: Continue with normal Q&A flow\n   - **Resume**: Continue where paused\n\n4. **On resume:**\n   ```\n   Resuming autopilot with your override: [change made]\n\n   Next question...\n   ```\n\n## Checkpoint Saving\n\n**After each decision** (in either mode), save state:\n\n```bash\n# Checkpoint file path\nCHECKPOINT=\"docs/plans/.brainstorm-checkpoint-$(date +%Y%m%d).json\"\n```\n\nCheckpoint JSON structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"topic\": \"user authentication feature\",\n  \"mode\": \"autopilot\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-01-18T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-18T10:35:00Z\",\n  \"decisions\": [\n    {\"q\": \"Target users?\", \"answer\": \"B2B enterprise\", \"source\": \"consensus\"},\n    {\"q\": \"Database?\", \"answer\": \"PostgreSQL\", \"source\": \"user\"}\n  ],\n  \"current_phase\": \"questions\",\n  \"project_context\": \"summary of what we're building\"\n}\n```\n\nWrite checkpoint after each decision using the Write tool.\n\n**Cleanup:** Delete checkpoint file when design is complete and saved to final document.\n\n## Context Management\n\n**Compact at phase transitions** to preserve context for later phases:\n\n- **Before design presentation** (after all questions answered): Run `/compact` with decisions summary:\n  ```\n  /compact Brainstorming [topic]. Decisions made: [list key decisions]. Mode: [interactive/autopilot]. Ready to present design.\n  ```\n- **Before consensus validation** (after design written): Run `/compact` with design file reference:\n  ```\n  /compact Design written to [file path]. Ready for multi-agent validation.\n  ```\n- **Before implementation handoff** (after validation): Run `/compact` with final state:\n  ```\n  /compact Design validated. File: [path]. Ready for implementation setup.\n  ```\n\n**Why:** Brainstorming accumulates substantial context from questions, consensus calls, and design iterations. Compacting before validation ensures the consensus agents get clean, focused context.\n\n## After the Design\n\n**For Autopilot Mode - Summarize Decisions:**\n```\nDesign complete. Consensus made [N] decisions:\n\n- Database: PostgreSQL (consensus)\n- API style: REST (consensus)\n- Frontend: React (you overrode → Vue)\n- Auth: JWT (consensus)\n...\n\nReview the full design below, then we'll run final validation.\n```\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n- **Delete checkpoint file** after successful save\n\n**Multi-Agent Design Validation (Recommended):**\n\nAfter the user validates the complete design, run multi-agent review:\n\n\"Running multi-agent validation. Claude, Gemini, and Codex will review for architectural flaws, over-engineering, and missing requirements...\"\n\n**Always run unless user explicitly skips:**\n1. Prepare validation prompt:\n   ```\n   Review this software design for issues. Find architectural flaws, missing\n   requirements, over-engineering, maintainability concerns, testing gaps, or\n   any other problems. Rate each issue as:\n   STRONG (critical flaw), MODERATE (should address), WEAK (minor concern)\n   ```\n\n2. Invoke consensus:\n   ```bash\n   DESIGN_TEXT=$(cat \"docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md\")\n\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"Review this software design...\" \\\n     --context=\"$DESIGN_TEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. Present results:\n   - **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found X critical concerns. Recommend addressing before implementation.\"\n   - **Medium Priority**: \"Y moderate concerns identified.

The file path should be configurable. The file and any parent directories should be created automatically if they don't exist.\n    17→- **Querying entries** — Users should be able to retrieve all entries, or filter entries by date range.\n    18→- **Summarizing time** — Users should be able to get a summary of total time spent per task name (in milliseconds). Multiple entries with the same task name should be summed together.

Frequent commits.\n\nAssume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.\n\n**Announce at start:** \"I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan.\"\n\n**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).\n\n**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`\n\n## Bite-Sized Task Granularity\n\n**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**\n- \"Write the failing test\" - step\n- \"Run it to make sure it fails\" - step\n- \"Implement the minimal code to make the test pass\" - step\n- \"Run the tests and make sure they pass\" - step\n- \"Commit\" - step\n\n## Plan Document Header\n\n**Every plan MUST start with this header:**\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan\n\n> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use conclave:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.\n\n**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]\n\n**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]\n\n**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]\n\n---\n```\n\n## Task Structure\n\n```markdown\n### Task N: [Component Name]\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`\n- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`\n- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`\n\n**Dependencies:** [Task N, Task M] or none\n\n**Step 1: Write the failing test**\n\n```python\ndef test_specific_behavior():\n    result = function(input)\n    assert result == expected\n```\n\n**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**\n\nRun: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`\nExpected: FAIL with \"function not defined\"\n\n**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**\n\n```python\ndef function(input):\n    return expected\n```\n\n**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**\n\nRun: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`\nExpected: PASS\n\n**Step 5: Commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py\ngit commit -m \"feat: add specific feature\"\n```\n```\n\n## Remember\n- Exact file paths always\n- Complete code in plan (not \"add validation\")\n- Exact commands with expected output\n- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax\n- Include Dependencies field for every task (required for parallel execution)\n- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits\n\n## Context Management\n\n**Compact before validation** — plan writing involves extensive codebase exploration:\n\n```\n/compact Plan written to [file path]. [N] tasks, [M] waves. Ready for consensus validation.\n```\n\n**Why:** Writing a plan requires reading many files, understanding architecture, and drafting detailed task specs. Compacting before validation ensures the consensus call and execution handoff have clean context.\n\n## Plan Validation with Multi-Agent Consensus\n\n**Before offering execution options**, validate the plan with multi-agent consensus:\n\n```bash\nPLAN_FILE=\"docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md\"\nPLAN_TEXT=$(cat \"$PLAN_FILE\")\n\nconclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n  --prompt=\"Review this implementation plan for: 1) Architectural soundness - is the approach appropriate? 2) Risk assessment - what could go wrong? 3) Scope validation - is this over/under-engineered? 4) Missing steps - are there gaps in the plan? Rate each concern as HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority.\" \\\n  --context=\"$PLAN_TEXT\"\n```\n\n**Present results to user:**\n- **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found architectural concerns. Recommend addressing before implementation.\"\n- **Medium Priority**: \"Some concerns raised. Would you like to review them?\"\n- **Low/None**: \"Plan validated by multi-agent review. Ready for execution.\"\n\n**Handle response:**\n- If High Priority issues → Revise plan, re-run consensus\n- If user accepts concerns → Proceed to Execution Handoff\n- If user wants to skip → Proceed (their choice)\n\n## Execution Handoff\n\n**If `CONCLAVE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`:** Skip the choice, use Subagent-Driven automatically.

Two execution options:**\n\n**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration\n\n**2.

Uses only Node.js built-in modules (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`).\n\n**Tech Stack:** TypeScript 5.4, ES2022 target, Node16 modules, vitest for testing.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1: Core Types and Constructor\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `src/index.ts`\n\n**Dependencies:** none\n\n**Step 1: Create src/index.ts with types and basic class skeleton**\n\n```typescript\nimport { randomUUID } from \"node:crypto\";\nimport { existsSync, mkdirSync, readFileSync, writeFileSync } from \"node:fs\";\nimport { dirname } from \"node:path\";\n\nexport interface TimeEntry {\n  id: string;\n  taskName: string;\n  startTime: string;\n  endTime: string | null;\n}\n\ninterface TrackerData {\n  entries: TimeEntry[];\n}\n\nexport class TimeTracker {\n  private filePath: string;\n  private entries: TimeEntry[];\n\n  constructor(filePath: string) {\n    this.filePath = filePath;\n    this.entries = [];\n    this.load();\n  }\n\n  private load(): void {\n    if (existsSync(this.filePath)) {\n      try {\n        const raw = readFileSync(this.filePath, \"utf-8\");\n        const data: TrackerData = JSON.parse(raw);\n        this.entries = data.entries;\n      } catch {\n        this.entries =

writeFileSync(this.filePath, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2), \"utf-8\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Run build to verify it compiles**\n\nRun: `npm run build`\nExpected: PASS (no errors)\n\n**Step 3: Run lint to verify code quality**\n\nRun: `npm run lint`\nExpected: PASS (no errors)\n\n**Step 4: Commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add src/index.ts\ngit commit -m \"feat: add TimeTracker class with types and

Uses only Node.js built-in modules (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`).\n\n**Tech Stack:** TypeScript 5.4, ES2022 target, Node16 modules, vitest for testing.\n\n---\n\n### Task 1: Core Types and Constructor\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `src/index.ts`\n\n**Dependencies:** none\n\n**Step 1: Create src/index.ts with types and basic class skeleton**\n\n```typescript\nimport { randomUUID } from

Tasks done: [list]. Tasks remaining: [list]. Current branch state: [summary]. Next wave: [tasks].\n  ```\n- **Before final consensus review**: Run `/compact` with focus on what was built:\n  ```\n  /compact All waves complete. Implemented: [summary of all tasks]. Ready for consensus review.\n  ```\n- **Before finishing-a-development-branch**: Run `/compact` with focus on merge readiness:\n  ```\n  /compact Implementation complete. [N] tasks done, [M] failed. Ready for branch completion.\n  ```\n\n**Why:** Each wave generates substantial output from task agents, merge operations, and conflict resolution. Without compaction, later waves run in degraded context.\n\n## Task Execution\n\n### Parallel Execution (default)\n\nRun all tasks through `conclave parallel-run`:\n\n```bash\n./skills/subagent-driven-development/conclave parallel-run \\\n    docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md \\\n    --max-concurrent 3 \\\n    --non-interactive\n```\n\nThe orchestrator handles everything automatically:\n1. **Parse plan** - Extracts tasks, dependencies, files\n2. **Compute waves** - Groups tasks by dependency depth\n3. **Execute waves** - Per wave:\n   - Creates git worktree per task (from merged state of prior waves)\n   - Launches `conclave ralph-run --worktree` in each worktree in parallel\n   - Polls for completion\n   - Squash-merges completed tasks in plan order\n   - Re-runs tasks on merge conflicts (up to `PARALLEL_MAX_CONFLICT_RERUNS`)\n4. **Consensus review** - Runs `conclave auto-review` on all merged changes\n5. **Cleanup** - Removes worktrees, prints summary\n\n### Dry Run (preview schedule)\n\n```bash\n./skills/subagent-driven-development/conclave parallel-run \\\n    docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md \\\n    --dry-run\n```\n\n### Sequential Fallback\n\nFor tightly-coupled tasks or debugging, run tasks one at a time:\n\n```bash\nTASK_SPEC=$(mktemp --suffix=.md)\n# Write task spec...\n./skills/ralph-loop/conclave ralph-run \"task-name\" \"$TASK_SPEC\" --non-interactive -d \"$(pwd)\"\n```\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```\n========================================\nParallel Runner\nPlan: docs/plans/feature-plan.md\nMax concurrent: 3\nBase branch: feature/my-feature\n========================================\n\n--- Phase 1: Parsing Plan ---\nTasks found: 5\nWaves: 3\n  Wave 0: tasks 1 2 3\n  Wave 1: tasks 4\n  Wave 2: tasks 5\n\n--- Phase 2: Setup ---\n\n--- Phase 3: Executing Waves ---\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nWave 0\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n[WAVE 0] Launching Task 1: Create utilities\n[WAVE 0] Launching Task 2: Build core module\n[WAVE 0] Launching Task 3: Add config parser\n[WAVE 0] Task 1 COMPLETED\n[WAVE 0] Task 2 COMPLETED\n[WAVE 0] Task 3 FAILED (exit 1)\n\n[WAVE 0] Merging completed tasks...\n[MERGE] Squash-merging task/1-create-utilities...\n[MERGE] Successfully merged task/1-create-utilities\n[MERGE] Squash-merging task/2-build-core-module...\n[MERGE] Successfully merged task/2-build-core-module\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nWave 1\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n[WAVE 1] Launching Task 4: Integration layer\n[WAVE 1] Task 4 COMPLETED\n\n[WAVE 1] Merging completed tasks...\n[MERGE] Successfully merged task/4-integration-layer\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nWave 2\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n[WAVE 2] Launching Task 5: CLI entry point\n[WAVE 2] Task 5 COMPLETED\n\n--- Phase 4: Consensus Review ---\nRunning consensus review on all merged changes...\n\n--- Cleanup ---\n\n========================================\nPARALLEL EXECUTION SUMMARY\n========================================\n  Completed: 4/5\n  Failed:    1\n  Skipped:   0\n========================================\n  Task 3 (Add config parser): FAILED -

ONLY THEN: Make the claim\n\nSkip any step = lying, not verifying\n```\n\n## Common Failures\n\n| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |\n|-------|----------|----------------|\n| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, \"should pass\" |\n| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |\n| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |\n| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |\n| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |\n| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports \"success\" |\n| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |\n\n## Red Flags - STOP\n\n- Using \"should\", \"probably\", \"seems to\"\n- Expressing satisfaction before verification (\"Great!\", \"Perfect!\", \"Done!\", etc.)\n- About to commit/push/PR without verification\n- Trusting agent success reports\n- Relying on partial verification\n- Thinking \"just this once\"\n- Tired and wanting work over\n- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**\n\n## Rationalization Prevention\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Should work now\" | RUN the verification |\n| \"I'm confident\" | Confidence ≠ evidence |\n| \"Just this once\" | No exceptions |\n| \"Linter passed\" | Linter ≠ compiler |\n| \"Agent said success\" | Verify independently |\n| \"I'm tired\" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |\n| \"Partial check is enough\" | Partial proves nothing |\n| \"Different words so rule doesn't apply\" | Spirit over letter |\n\n## Key Patterns\n\n**Tests:**\n```\n✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] \"All tests pass\"\n❌ \"Should pass now\" / \"Looks correct\"\n```\n\n**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**\n```\n✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)\n❌ \"I've written a regression test\" (without red-green verification)\n```\n\n**Build:**\n```\n✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] \"Build passes\"\n❌ \"Linter passed\" (linter doesn't check compilation)\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n```\n✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion\n❌ \"Tests pass, phase complete\"\n```\n\n**Agent delegation:**\n```\n✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state\n❌ Trust agent report\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nFrom 24 failure memories:\n- your human partner said \"I don't believe you\" - trust broken\n- Undefined functions shipped - would crash\n- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features\n- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework\n- Violates: \"Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced.\"\n\n## When To Apply\n\n**ALWAYS before:**\n- ANY variation of success/completion claims\n- ANY expression of satisfaction\n- ANY positive statement about work state\n- Committing, PR creation, task completion\n- Moving to next task\n- Delegating to agents\n\n**Rule applies to:**\n- Exact phrases\n- Paraphrases and synonyms\n- Implications of success\n- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness\n\n## Multi-Agent Final Verification (For Significant Work)\n\n**When to use:** Before claiming completion on significant features, bug fixes, or refactors.\n\n**When to skip:** Trivial changes, typos, single-line fixes.\n\nAfter local verification passes, run multi-agent consensus on the changes:\n\n```bash\n# Auto-detects base SHA, reviews all changes\nconclave auto-review \"Final verification: <description>\"\n```\n\n**Present results:**\n- **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found issues. Must address before claiming complete.\"\n- **Medium Priority**: \"Some concerns raised. Review before finalizing.\"\n- **Consider only**: \"Verified by local tests AND multi-agent review. Work complete.\"\n\n**This catches:**\n- Issues your tests don't cover\n- Patterns that look wrong to fresh eyes\n- Edge cases you didn't consider\n- Security or performance concerns\n\n**The enhanced gate function for significant work:**\n```\n1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?\n2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)\n3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures\n4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?\n5. CONSENSUS: Run multi-agent review on changes\n6. ONLY THEN: Make the claim\n```\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**No shortcuts for verification.**\n\nRun the command. Read the output. Get consensus on significant work. THEN claim the result.\n\nThis is non-negotiable.\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"e4314408-87be-4deb-aafe-ca5840276c59","uuid":"dd24b707-49c7-433c-a3b1-11bec93f91be","isSynthetic":true}

Must fix before completing:\n\n[Show failures]\n\nCannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.\n```\n\nStop. Don't proceed to Step 2.\n\n**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.\n\n### Step 2: Final Consensus Review\n\nBefore presenting merge options, run final multi-agent consensus review on all branch changes:\n\n```bash\n# Get base SHA from merge-base\nBASE=$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)\nconclave auto-review --base=\"$BASE\" \"Final review before merge\"\n```\n\n**If High Priority issues found:**\n```\nConsensus review found High Priority issues:\n\n[Show issues]\n\nRecommend addressing before merge. Would you like to:\n1. Fix issues now\n2. Proceed anyway (not recommended)\n```\n\n**If Medium Priority issues found:**\n- Present them as recommendations\n- Don't block merge\n\n**If no issues or only Consider tier:**\n- Continue to Step 3\n\n### Context Management\n\n**Compact before presenting options** if this skill follows a long session (e.g., after subagent-driven-development or executing-plans):\n\n```\n/compact Branch [name] ready for completion. Tests: passing. Consensus review: [summary]. Ready to present merge options.\n```\n\n**Why:** This skill is typically called at the end of a long implementation session. Compacting ensures the merge/PR workflow has clean context.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Base Branch\n\n```bash\n# Try common base branches\ngit merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nOr ask: \"This branch split from main - is that correct?\"\n\n### Step 4: Present Options\n\n**If `CONCLAVE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`:** Skip the choice, merge locally (Option 1) automatically. Announce: \"Non-interactive mode: merging to <base-branch>.\"\n\nOtherwise, present exactly these 4 options:\n\n```\nImplementation complete. What would you like to do?\n\n1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally\n2. Push and create a Pull Request\n3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)\n4. Discard this work\n\nWhich option?\n```\n\n**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.\n\n### Step 5: Execute Choice\n\n#### Option 1: Merge Locally\n\n```bash\n# Switch to base branch\ngit checkout <base-branch>\n\n# Pull latest\ngit pull\n\n# Merge feature branch\ngit merge <feature-branch>\n\n# Verify tests on merged result\n<test command>\n\n# If tests pass\ngit branch -d <feature-branch>\n```\n\nThen: Cleanup worktree (Step 6)\n\n#### Option 2: Push and Create PR\n\n```bash\n# Push branch\ngit push -u origin <feature-branch>\n\n# Create PR\ngh pr create --title \"<title>\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<2-3 bullets of what changed>\n\n## Test Plan\n- [ ] <verification steps>\nEOF\n)\"\n```\n\nThen: Cleanup worktree (Step 6)\n\n#### Option 3: Keep As-Is\n\nReport: \"Keeping branch <name>.
