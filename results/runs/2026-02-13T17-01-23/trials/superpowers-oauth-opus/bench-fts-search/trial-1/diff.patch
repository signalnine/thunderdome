Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.\n\n**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.\n\n**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Always:**\n- New features\n- Bug fixes\n- Refactoring\n- Behavior changes\n\n**Exceptions (ask your human partner):**\n- Throwaway prototypes\n- Generated code\n- Configuration files\n\nThinking \"skip TDD just this once\"? Stop. That's rationalization.\n\n## The Iron Law\n\n```\nNO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST\n```\n\nWrite code before the test? Delete it. Start over.\n\n**No exceptions:**\n- Don't keep it as \"reference\"\n- Don't \"adapt\" it while writing tests\n- Don't look at it\n- Delete means delete\n\nImplement fresh from tests. Period.\n\n## Red-Green-Refactor\n\n```dot\ndigraph tdd_cycle {\n    rankdir=LR;\n    red [label=\"RED\\nWrite failing test\", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=\"#ffcccc\"];\n    verify_red [label=\"Verify fails\\ncorrectly\", shape=diamond];\n    green [label=\"GREEN\\nMinimal code\", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=\"#ccffcc\"];\n    verify_green [label=\"Verify passes\\nAll green\", shape=diamond];\n    refactor [label=\"REFACTOR\\nClean up\", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=\"#ccccff\"];\n    next [label=\"Next\", shape=ellipse];\n\n    red -> verify_red;\n    verify_red -> green [label=\"yes\"];\n    verify_red -> red [label=\"wrong\\nfailure\"];\n    green -> verify_green;\n    verify_green -> refactor [label=\"yes\"];\n    verify_green -> green [label=\"no\"];\n    refactor -> verify_green [label=\"stay\\ngreen\"];\n    verify_green -> next;\n    next -> red;\n}\n```\n\n### RED - Write Failing Test\n\nWrite one minimal test showing what should happen.\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\ntest('retries failed operations 3 times', async () => {\n  let attempts = 0;\n  const operation = () => {\n    attempts++;\n    if (attempts < 3) throw new Error('fail');\n    return 'success';\n  };\n\n  const result = await retryOperation(operation);\n\n  expect(result).toBe('success');\n  expect(attempts).toBe(3);\n});\n```\nClear name, tests real behavior, one thing\n</Good>\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\ntest('retry works', async () => {\n  const mock = jest.fn()\n    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error())\n    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error())\n    .mockResolvedValueOnce('success');\n  await retryOperation(mock);\n  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);\n});\n```\nVague name, tests mock not code\n</Bad>\n\n**Requirements:**\n- One behavior\n- Clear name\n- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)\n\n### Verify RED - Watch It Fail\n\n**MANDATORY. Never skip.**\n\n```bash\nnpm test path/to/test.test.ts\n```\n\nConfirm:\n- Test fails (not errors)\n- Failure message is expected\n- Fails because feature missing (not typos)\n\n**Test passes?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix test.\n\n**Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly.\n\n### GREEN - Minimal Code\n\nWrite simplest code to pass the test.\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\nasync function retryOperation<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {\n  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n    try {\n      return await fn();\n    } catch (e) {\n      if (i === 2) throw e;\n    }\n  }\n  throw new Error('unreachable');\n}\n```\nJust enough to pass\n</Good>\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\nasync function retryOperation<T>(\n  fn: () => Promise<T>,\n  options?: {\n    maxRetries?: number;\n    backoff?: 'linear' | 'exponential';\n    onRetry?: (attempt: number) => void;\n  }\n): Promise<T> {\n  // YAGNI\n}\n```\nOver-engineered\n</Bad>\n\nDon't add features, refactor other code, or \"improve\" beyond the test.\n\n### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass\n\n**MANDATORY.**\n\n```bash\nnpm test path/to/test.test.ts\n```\n\nConfirm:\n- Test passes\n- Other tests still pass\n- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)\n\n**Test fails?** Fix code, not test.\n\n**Other tests fail?** Fix now.\n\n### REFACTOR - Clean Up\n\nAfter green only:\n- Remove duplication\n- Improve names\n- Extract helpers\n\nKeep tests green. Don't add behavior.\n\n### Repeat\n\nNext failing test for next feature.\n\n## Good Tests\n\n| Quality | Good | Bad |\n|---------|------|-----|\n| **Minimal** | One thing. \"and\" in name? Split it. | `test('validates email and domain and whitespace')` |\n| **Clear** | Name describes behavior | `test('test1')` |\n| **Shows intent** | Demonstrates desired API | Obscures what code should do |\n\n## Why Order Matters\n\n**\"I'll write tests after to verify it works\"**\n\nTests written after code pass immediately. Passing immediately proves nothing:\n- Might test wrong thing\n- Might test implementation, not behavior\n- Might miss edge cases you forgot\n- You never saw it catch the bug\n\nTest-first forces you to see the test fail, proving it actually tests something.\n\n**\"I already manually tested all the edge cases\"**\n\nManual testing is ad-hoc. You think you tested everything but:\n- No record of what you tested\n- Can't re-run when code changes\n- Easy to forget cases under pressure\n- \"It worked when I tried it\" ≠ comprehensive\n\nAutomated tests are systematic. They run the same way every time.\n\n**\"Deleting X hours of work is wasteful\"**\n\nSunk cost fallacy. The time is already gone. Your choice now:\n- Delete and rewrite with TDD (X more hours, high confidence)\n- Keep it and add tests after (30 min, low confidence, likely bugs)\n\nThe \"waste\" is keeping code you can't trust. Working code without real tests is technical debt.\n\n**\"TDD is dogmatic, being pragmatic means adapting\"**\n\nTDD IS pragmatic:\n- Finds bugs before commit (faster than debugging after)\n- Prevents regressions (tests catch breaks immediately)\n- Documents behavior (tests show how to use code)\n- Enables refactoring (change freely, tests catch breaks)\n\n\"Pragmatic\" shortcuts = debugging in production = slower.\n\n**\"Tests after achieve the same goals - it's spirit not ritual\"**\n\nNo. Tests-after answer \"What does this do?\" Tests-first answer \"What should this do?\"\n\nTests-after are biased by your implementation. You test what you built, not what's required. You verify remembered edge cases, not discovered ones.\n\nTests-first force edge case discovery before implementing. Tests-after verify you remembered everything (you didn't).\n\n30 minutes of tests after ≠ TDD. You get coverage, lose proof tests work.\n\n## Common Rationalizations\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Too simple to test\" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |\n| \"I'll test after\" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |\n| \"Tests after achieve same goals\" | Tests-after = \"what does this do?\" Tests-first = \"what should this do?\" |\n| \"Already manually tested\" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run. |\n| \"Deleting X hours is wasteful\" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is technical debt. |\n| \"Keep as reference, write tests first\" | You'll adapt it. That's testing after. Delete means delete. |\n| \"Need to explore first\" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD. |\n| \"Test hard = design unclear\" | Listen to test. Hard to test = hard to use. |\n| \"TDD will slow me down\" | TDD faster than debugging. Pragmatic = test-first. |\n| \"Manual test faster\" | Manual doesn't prove edge cases. You'll re-test every change. |\n| \"Existing code has no tests\" | You're improving it. Add tests for existing code. |\n\n## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over\n\n- Code before test\n- Test after implementation\n- Test passes immediately\n- Can't explain why test failed\n- Tests added \"later\"\n- Rationalizing \"just this once\"\n- \"I already manually tested it\"\n- \"Tests after achieve the same purpose\"\n- \"It's about spirit not ritual\"\n- \"Keep as reference\" or \"adapt existing code\"\n- \"Already spent X hours, deleting is wasteful\"\n- \"TDD is dogmatic, I'm being pragmatic\"\n- \"This is different because...\"\n\n**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**\n\n## Example: Bug Fix\n\n**Bug:** Empty email accepted\n\n**RED**\n```typescript\ntest('rejects empty email', async () => {\n  const result = await submitForm({ email: '' });\n  expect(result.error).toBe('Email required');\n});\n```\n\n**Verify RED**\n```bash\n$ npm test\nFAIL: expected 'Email required', got undefined\n```\n\n**GREEN**\n```typescript\nfunction submitForm(data: FormData) {\n  if (!data.email?.trim()) {\n    return { error: 'Email required' };\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Verify GREEN**\n```bash\n$ npm test\nPASS\n```\n\n**REFACTOR**\nExtract validation for multiple fields if needed.\n\n## Verification Checklist\n\nBefore marking work complete:\n\n- [ ] Every new function/method has a test\n- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing\n- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)\n- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test\n- [ ] All tests pass\n- [ ] Output pristine (no errors, warnings)\n- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)\n- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered\n\nCan't check all boxes? You skipped TDD. Start over.\n\n## When Stuck\n\n| Problem | Solution |\n|---------|----------|\n| Don't know how to test | Write wished-for API. Write assertion first.
