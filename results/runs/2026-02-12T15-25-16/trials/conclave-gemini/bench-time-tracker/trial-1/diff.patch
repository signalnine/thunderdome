Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## Session Recovery\n\n**At the start of every brainstorming session**, check for incomplete checkpoints:\n\n```bash\nls docs/plans/.brainstorm-checkpoint-*.json 2>/dev/null | head -1\n```\n\nIf checkpoint exists and is less than 24 hours old:\n\n```\nFound incomplete brainstorming session from [time ago]:\nTopic: \"[topic from checkpoint]\"\nProgress: [N] questions answered ([mode] mode)\n\nOptions:\n1. Resume from checkpoint\n2. Start fresh (discards previous progress)\n```\n\nOn resume:\n- Load decisions from checkpoint JSON\n- Summarize: \"Resuming. Decisions so far: [list key decisions]...\"\n- Continue from where session left off\n\nIf no checkpoint or user chooses fresh start, proceed to The Process.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Then offer mode selection (see below)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Mode Selection** (after checking project context):\n\n**If `CONCLAVE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`:** Skip mode selection, use Consensus Autopilot automatically. Announce: \"Non-interactive mode: using Consensus Autopilot.\"\n\nOtherwise, present the choice:\n\n```\nI'll help design this feature. Two modes available:\n\n1. **Interactive** - I ask questions, you answer, we iterate together\n2. **Consensus Autopilot** - Multi-agent consensus (Claude, Gemini, Codex)\n   answers design questions. You watch decisions narrate and can interrupt\n   anytime to override.\n\nNote: Autopilot calls consensus for each question (~30-60 seconds each).\nFull design typically takes 5-10 minutes.\n\nWhich mode?\n```\n\n- If **Interactive**: Proceed with normal question flow (one at a time, user answers)\n- If **Autopilot**: See \"Autopilot Mode\" section below\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## Autopilot Mode\n\nWhen user selects autopilot, announce: \"Starting autopilot. I'll narrate each decision. Jump in anytime to override.\"\n\n**For each design question:**\n\n1. **Format the question for consensus:**\n   ```\n   Design decision needed: [question]\n\n   Context: [what we're building, decisions made so far]\n\n   Options I'm considering:\n   - Option A: [description]\n   - Option B: [description]\n   - Option C: [description]\n\n   You may suggest alternatives. Recommend one option with brief reasoning.\n   ```\n\n2. **Call consensus:**\n   ```bash\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"$FORMATTED_QUESTION\" \\\n     --context=\"$PROJECT_CONTEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Narrate the result:**\n   ```\n   Q: What database technology?\n   → Consensus recommends: PostgreSQL\n     Reasoning: \"Relational model fits the entity relationships,\n     ACID compliance needed for financial data, team has experience.\"\n\n   Proceeding...\n   ```\n\n4. **Save checkpoint** (see Checkpoint Saving below)\n\n5. **Continue to next question** - if user sends any message, that's an interrupt\n\n**Error Handling:**\n\nIf consensus fails (timeout, API errors, <2 agents respond):\n```\nConsensus unavailable for this question. Falling back to interactive:\n\nQ: What database technology?\nOptions:\n1. PostgreSQL - relational, ACID compliant\n2. MongoDB - document store, flexible schema\n3. SQLite - embedded, simple\n\nYour choice?\n```\nAfter user answers, offer: \"Resume autopilot for remaining questions, or stay interactive?\"\n\nIf consensus returns split decision (no clear winner):\n```\nConsensus split on this question:\n- Claude recommends PostgreSQL (relational model fits)\n- Gemini recommends MongoDB (schema flexibility)\n- Codex recommends PostgreSQL (team experience)\n\nNo strong consensus. Your call - which direction?\n```\nThen resume autopilot after user decides.\n\n## Interrupt Handling\n\nWhen user sends any message during autopilot:\n\n1. **Pause immediately** and acknowledge\n\n2. **Present options:**\n   ```\n   Paused. What would you like to change?\n\n   Last decision: [question → answer]\n\n   Options:\n   - Override this decision (tell me your preference)\n   - Go back further (redo earlier decisions)\n   - Switch to interactive mode (take over from here)\n   - Resume autopilot (continue as-is)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handle response:**\n   - **Override**: Record user's choice, resume autopilot from next question\n   - **Go back**: Show recent decisions, let user pick restart point, then re-run ALL subsequent questions with fresh consensus (don't reuse old answers)\n   - **Switch to interactive**: Continue with normal Q&A flow\n   - **Resume**: Continue where paused\n\n4. **On resume:**\n   ```\n   Resuming autopilot with your override: [change made]\n\n   Next question...\n   ```\n\n## Checkpoint Saving\n\n**After each decision** (in either mode), save state:\n\n```bash\n# Checkpoint file path\nCHECKPOINT=\"docs/plans/.brainstorm-checkpoint-$(date +%Y%m%d).json\"\n```\n\nCheckpoint JSON structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"topic\": \"user authentication feature\",\n  \"mode\": \"autopilot\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-01-18T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-18T10:35:00Z\",\n  \"decisions\": [\n    {\"q\": \"Target users?\", \"answer\": \"B2B enterprise\", \"source\": \"consensus\"},\n    {\"q\": \"Database?\", \"answer\": \"PostgreSQL\", \"source\": \"user\"}\n  ],\n  \"current_phase\": \"questions\",\n  \"project_context\": \"summary of what we're building\"\n}\n```\n\nWrite checkpoint after each decision using the Write tool.\n\n**Cleanup:** Delete checkpoint file when design is complete and saved to final document.\n\n## Context Management\n\n**Compact at phase transitions** to preserve context for later phases:\n\n- **Before design presentation** (after all questions answered): Run `/compact` with decisions summary:\n  ```\n  /compact Brainstorming [topic]. Decisions made: [list key decisions]. Mode: [interactive/autopilot]. Ready to present design.\n  ```\n- **Before consensus validation** (after design written): Run `/compact` with design file reference:\n  ```\n  /compact Design written to [file path]. Ready for multi-agent validation.\n  ```\n- **Before implementation handoff** (after validation): Run `/compact` with final state:\n  ```\n  /compact Design validated. File: [path]. Ready for implementation setup.\n  ```\n\n**Why:** Brainstorming accumulates substantial context from questions, consensus calls, and design iterations. Compacting before validation ensures the consensus agents get clean, focused context.\n\n## After the Design\n\n**For Autopilot Mode - Summarize Decisions:**\n```\nDesign complete. Consensus made [N] decisions:\n\n- Database: PostgreSQL (consensus)\n- API style: REST (consensus)\n- Frontend: React (you overrode → Vue)\n- Auth: JWT (consensus)\n...\n\nReview the full design below, then we'll run final validation.\n```\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n- **Delete checkpoint file** after successful save\n\n**Multi-Agent Design Validation (Recommended):**\n\nAfter the user validates the complete design, run multi-agent review:\n\n\"Running multi-agent validation. Claude, Gemini, and Codex will review for architectural flaws, over-engineering, and missing requirements...\"\n\n**Always run unless user explicitly skips:**\n1. Prepare validation prompt:\n   ```\n   Review this software design for issues. Find architectural flaws, missing\n   requirements, over-engineering, maintainability concerns, testing gaps, or\n   any other problems. Rate each issue as:\n   STRONG (critical flaw), MODERATE (should address), WEAK (minor concern)\n   ```\n\n2. Invoke consensus:\n   ```bash\n   DESIGN_TEXT=$(cat \"docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md\")\n\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"Review this software design...\" \\\n     --context=\"$DESIGN_TEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. Present results:\n   - **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found X critical concerns. Recommend addressing before implementation.\"\n   - **Medium Priority**: \"Y moderate concerns identified. Review recommended.\"\n   - **Consider only**: \"Design validated. Z minor suggestions noted.\"\n\n4. Handle response:\n   - High Priority issues → Revise design, re-run consensus\n   - User accepts concerns → Proceed to Implementation\n   - User wants details → Show full consensus breakdown from `/tmp/consensus-*.md`\n\n5. **For Autopilot Mode - Flag self-disagreement:**\n   If validation consensus disagrees with a decision made during autopilot:\n   ```\n   Interesting: Validation consensus questions the PostgreSQL choice\n   made earlier. They suggest considering SQLite for this scale.\n   Want to revisit?\n   ```\n\n**Implementation (if continuing):**\n- Ask: \"Ready to set up for implementation?\"\n- Use conclave:using-git-worktrees to create isolated workspace\n- Use conclave:writing-plans to create detailed implementation plan\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions\n- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible\n- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs\n- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling\n- **Incremental validation** - Present design in sections, validate each\n- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"3b2e7620-d357-498e-bb1b-4e3a4b47796f","uuid":"cb387af0-16b8-4b72-88ad-a87e8f87ce8b","isSynthetic":true}
