Once you understand what you're building, present the design in small sections (200-300 words), checking after each section whether it looks right so far.\n\n## Session Recovery\n\n**At the start of every brainstorming session**, check for incomplete checkpoints:\n\n```bash\nls docs/plans/.brainstorm-checkpoint-*.json 2>/dev/null | head -1\n```\n\nIf checkpoint exists and is less than 24 hours old:\n\n```\nFound incomplete brainstorming session from [time ago]:\nTopic: \"[topic from checkpoint]\"\nProgress: [N] questions answered ([mode] mode)\n\nOptions:\n1. Resume from checkpoint\n2. Start fresh (discards previous progress)\n```\n\nOn resume:\n- Load decisions from checkpoint JSON\n- Summarize: \"Resuming. Decisions so far: [list key decisions]...\"\n- Continue from where session left off\n\nIf no checkpoint or user chooses fresh start, proceed to The Process.\n\n## The Process\n\n**Understanding the idea:**\n- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)\n- Then offer mode selection (see below)\n- Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea\n- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too\n- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions\n- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria\n\n**Mode Selection** (after checking project context):\n\n**If `CONCLAVE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`:** Skip mode selection, use Consensus Autopilot automatically. Announce: \"Non-interactive mode: using Consensus Autopilot.\"\n\nOtherwise, present the choice:\n\n```\nI'll help design this feature. Two modes available:\n\n1. **Interactive** - I ask questions, you answer, we iterate together\n2. **Consensus Autopilot** - Multi-agent consensus (Claude, Gemini, Codex)\n   answers design questions. You watch decisions narrate and can interrupt\n   anytime to override.\n\nNote: Autopilot calls consensus for each question (~30-60 seconds each).\nFull design typically takes 5-10 minutes.\n\nWhich mode?\n```\n\n- If **Interactive**: Proceed with normal question flow (one at a time, user answers)\n- If **Autopilot**: See \"Autopilot Mode\" section below\n\n**Exploring approaches:**\n- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs\n- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning\n- Lead with your recommended option and explain why\n\n**Presenting the design:**\n- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design\n- Break it into sections of 200-300 words\n- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far\n- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing\n- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense\n\n## Autopilot Mode\n\nWhen user selects autopilot, announce: \"Starting autopilot. I'll narrate each decision. Jump in anytime to override.\"\n\n**For each design question:**\n\n1. **Format the question for consensus:**\n   ```\n   Design decision needed: [question]\n\n   Context: [what we're building, decisions made so far]\n\n   Options I'm considering:\n   - Option A: [description]\n   - Option B: [description]\n   - Option C: [description]\n\n   You may suggest alternatives. Recommend one option with brief reasoning.\n   ```\n\n2. **Call consensus:**\n   ```bash\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"$FORMATTED_QUESTION\" \\\n     --context=\"$PROJECT_CONTEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Narrate the result:**\n   ```\n   Q: What database technology?\n   → Consensus recommends: PostgreSQL\n     Reasoning: \"Relational model fits the entity relationships,\n     ACID compliance needed for financial data, team has experience.\"\n\n   Proceeding...\n   ```\n\n4. **Save checkpoint** (see Checkpoint Saving below)\n\n5. **Continue to next question** - if user sends any message, that's an interrupt\n\n**Error Handling:**\n\nIf consensus fails (timeout, API errors, <2 agents respond):\n```\nConsensus unavailable for this question. Falling back to interactive:\n\nQ: What database technology?\nOptions:\n1. PostgreSQL - relational, ACID compliant\n2. MongoDB - document store, flexible schema\n3. SQLite - embedded, simple\n\nYour choice?\n```\nAfter user answers, offer: \"Resume autopilot for remaining questions, or stay interactive?\"\n\nIf consensus returns split decision (no clear winner):\n```\nConsensus split on this question:\n- Claude recommends PostgreSQL (relational model fits)\n- Gemini recommends MongoDB (schema flexibility)\n- Codex recommends PostgreSQL (team experience)\n\nNo strong consensus. Your call - which direction?\n```\nThen resume autopilot after user decides.\n\n## Interrupt Handling\n\nWhen user sends any message during autopilot:\n\n1. **Pause immediately** and acknowledge\n\n2. **Present options:**\n   ```\n   Paused. What would you like to change?\n\n   Last decision: [question → answer]\n\n   Options:\n   - Override this decision (tell me your preference)\n   - Go back further (redo earlier decisions)\n   - Switch to interactive mode (take over from here)\n   - Resume autopilot (continue as-is)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handle response:**\n   - **Override**: Record user's choice, resume autopilot from next question\n   - **Go back**: Show recent decisions, let user pick restart point, then re-run ALL subsequent questions with fresh consensus (don't reuse old answers)\n   - **Switch to interactive**: Continue with normal Q&A flow\n   - **Resume**: Continue where paused\n\n4. **On resume:**\n   ```\n   Resuming autopilot with your override: [change made]\n\n   Next question...\n   ```\n\n## Checkpoint Saving\n\n**After each decision** (in either mode), save state:\n\n```bash\n# Checkpoint file path\nCHECKPOINT=\"docs/plans/.brainstorm-checkpoint-$(date +%Y%m%d).json\"\n```\n\nCheckpoint JSON structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"topic\": \"user authentication feature\",\n  \"mode\": \"autopilot\",\n  \"created_at\": \"2025-01-18T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"updated_at\": \"2025-01-18T10:35:00Z\",\n  \"decisions\": [\n    {\"q\": \"Target users?\", \"answer\": \"B2B enterprise\", \"source\": \"consensus\"},\n    {\"q\": \"Database?\", \"answer\": \"PostgreSQL\", \"source\": \"user\"}\n  ],\n  \"current_phase\": \"questions\",\n  \"project_context\": \"summary of what we're building\"\n}\n```\n\nWrite checkpoint after each decision using the Write tool.\n\n**Cleanup:** Delete checkpoint file when design is complete and saved to final document.\n\n## Context Management\n\n**Compact at phase transitions** to preserve context for later phases:\n\n- **Before design presentation** (after all questions answered): Run `/compact` with decisions summary:\n  ```\n  /compact Brainstorming [topic]. Decisions made: [list key decisions]. Mode: [interactive/autopilot]. Ready to present design.\n  ```\n- **Before consensus validation** (after design written): Run `/compact` with design file reference:\n  ```\n  /compact Design written to [file path]. Ready for multi-agent validation.\n  ```\n- **Before implementation handoff** (after validation): Run `/compact` with final state:\n  ```\n  /compact Design validated. File: [path]. Ready for implementation setup.\n  ```\n\n**Why:** Brainstorming accumulates substantial context from questions, consensus calls, and design iterations. Compacting before validation ensures the consensus agents get clean, focused context.\n\n## After the Design\n\n**For Autopilot Mode - Summarize Decisions:**\n```\nDesign complete. Consensus made [N] decisions:\n\n- Database: PostgreSQL (consensus)\n- API style: REST (consensus)\n- Frontend: React (you overrode → Vue)\n- Auth: JWT (consensus)\n...\n\nReview the full design below, then we'll run final validation.\n```\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Write the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`\n- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available\n- Commit the design document to git\n- **Delete checkpoint file** after successful save\n\n**Multi-Agent Design Validation (Recommended):**\n\nAfter the user validates the complete design, run multi-agent review:\n\n\"Running multi-agent validation. Claude, Gemini, and Codex will review for architectural flaws, over-engineering, and missing requirements...\"\n\n**Always run unless user explicitly skips:**\n1. Prepare validation prompt:\n   ```\n   Review this software design for issues. Find architectural flaws, missing\n   requirements, over-engineering, maintainability concerns, testing gaps, or\n   any other problems. Rate each issue as:\n   STRONG (critical flaw), MODERATE (should address), WEAK (minor concern)\n   ```\n\n2. Invoke consensus:\n   ```bash\n   DESIGN_TEXT=$(cat \"docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md\")\n\n   conclave consensus --mode=general-prompt \\\n     --prompt=\"Review this software design...\" \\\n     --context=\"$DESIGN_TEXT\"\n   ```\n\n3. Present results:\n   - **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found X critical concerns. Recommend addressing before implementation.\"\n   - **Medium Priority**: \"Y moderate concerns identified. Review recommended.\"\n   - **Consider only**: \"Design validated. Z minor suggestions noted.\"\n\n4. Handle response:\n   - High Priority issues → Revise design, re-run consensus\n   - User accepts concerns → Proceed to Implementation\n   - User wants details → Show full consensus breakdown from `/tmp/consensus-*.md`\n\n5. **For Autopilot Mode - Flag self-disagreement:**\n   If validation consensus disagrees with a decision made during autopilot:\n   ```\n   Interesting: Validation consensus questions the PostgreSQL choice\n   made earlier.

API ROUTES (src/routes.ts)\n\n**CRUD Operations**:\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |\n|--------|----------|---------|\n| GET | `/notes` | List all notes (supports `?tag=X` filter) |\n| GET | `/notes/:id` | Get single note by ID |\n| POST | `/notes` | Create new note (requires title & body) |\n| PUT | `/notes/:id` | Update existing note |\n| DELETE | `/notes/:id` | Delete note |\n\n**Route Features**:\n- Tag filtering via JSON array manipulation with `json_each()` SQLite function\n- Proper validation: throws `ValidationError` if title or body missing\n- Returns 404 `NotFoundError` for non-existent notes\n- Auto-updates `updated_at` timestamp on PUT\n- Returns 201 status on POST, 204 on DELETE\n\n**Note**: Search endpoints (`/notes/search`, `/notes/search/suggest`) are tested but NOT implemented in routes.ts - they need to be added\n\n---\n\n### 6. ERROR HANDLING (src/errors.ts)\n\n**Custom Error Classes**:\n\n1. **NotFoundError**\n   - HTTP Status: 404\n   - Used when note doesn't exist\n\n2. **ValidationError**\n   - HTTP Status: 400\n   - Used for invalid input (missing title/body)\n\n**Error Handler Middleware**:\n- `errorHandler()`: Express error middleware\n- Catches and formats specific errors with appropriate status codes\n- Returns 500 for unexpected errors with generic message\n- Logs errors to console\n\n**Response Format**:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"error message\"\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. SERVER SETUP (src/server.ts)\n\n**Main Exports**:\n\n```typescript\ninterface App {\n  app: express.Express;\n  db: Database.Database;\n}\n\ncreateApp(dbPath?): App\n```\n- Creates Express app with empty database\n- Registers JSON middleware\n- Registers routes and error handler\n\n```typescript\ncreateSeededApp(dbPath?): App\n```\n- Creates app AND populates with 40 seed notes\n- Used for testing and development\n\n**Startup**:\n- If run directly: starts server on PORT (default 3000) with seeded data\n\n---\n\n### 8. SEED SCRIPT (src/seed.ts)\n\n**Purpose**: CLI tool to seed a database file\n\n**Usage**: \n```bash\nnpm run seed [path]\n```\n\n**Behavior**:\n- Takes optional database path argument (defaults to `notes.db`)\n- Creates database and inserts 40 notes\n- Logs success message with count\n- Closes database connection\n\n**Seed Data** (40 notes covering):\n- Programming: TypeScript, Python, Rust, React Hooks, Docker, Kubernetes, Git, etc.\n- Cooking: Pasta, Cookies, Risotto, Sourdough, Thai, French, Espresso, etc.\n- Travel: Tokyo, Paris, Southeast Asia, Kilimanjaro, Appalachian Trail, etc.\n- Science: Quantum Computing, Solar System, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, etc.\n- Music: Jazz, Classical, Guitar, Learning\n- Health: Mediterranean Diet, Yoga, Meditation, Sleep, Fitness\n- Arts: Photography, Watercolor, Astrophotography, etc.\n- Technology: Blockchain, GraphQL vs REST, Web Accessibility, CSS Grid, etc.\n\n---\n\n### 9. TEST FILES\n\n#### 9.1 NOTES CRUD TESTS (tests/notes.test.ts)\n\n**15 Test Cases** covering:\n\n1. GET /notes returns all notes\n2. GET /notes/:id returns specific note\n3. GET /notes/:id returns 404 for non-existent\n4. POST /notes creates note with title and body\n5. POST /notes creates note with tags\n6. POST /notes returns 400 without title\n7. POST /notes returns 400 without body\n8. PUT /notes/:id updates note\n9. PUT /notes/:id returns 404 for non-existent\n10. DELETE /notes/:id removes note\n11. DELETE /notes/:id returns 404 for non-existent\n12. GET /notes?tag=X filters by tag\n13. Notes have created_at timestamp\n14. Notes have updated_at timestamp\n15. PUT updates updated_at timestamp\n\n**Setup**: Uses in-memory database, no seeding\n\n#### 9.2 SEARCH TESTS (tests/search.test.ts)\n\n**20 Test Cases** covering full-text search expectations:\n\n1. GET /notes/search?q=keyword returns matching notes\n2. Results have snippet field\n3. Snippets contain <mark> tags around matched terms\n4. Results ranked by relevance (ascending rank = better match)\n5. Exact phrase search with quotes: `?q=\"exact phrase\"`\n6. Search returns id, title, snippet, rank fields\n7. Non-existent search returns empty array\n8. Missing q parameter returns 400\n9. Empty q parameter returns 400\n10. Pagination: page=1 returns first 20 results\n11.

Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.\n\nAssume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.\n\n**Announce at start:** \"I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan.\"\n\n**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).\n\n**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`\n\n## Bite-Sized Task Granularity\n\n**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**\n- \"Write the failing test\" - step\n- \"Run it to make sure it fails\" - step\n- \"Implement the minimal code to make the test pass\" - step\n- \"Run the tests and make sure they pass\" - step\n- \"Commit\" - step\n\n## Plan Document Header\n\n**Every plan MUST start with this header:**\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan\n\n> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use conclave:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.\n\n**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]\n\n**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]\n\n**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]\n\n---\n```\n\n## Task Structure\n\n```markdown\n### Task N: [Component Name]\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`\n- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`\n- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`\n\n**Dependencies:** [Task N, Task M] or none\n\n**Step 1: Write the failing test**\n\n```python\ndef test_specific_behavior():\n    result = function(input)\n    assert result == expected\n```\n\n**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**\n\nRun: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`\nExpected: FAIL with \"function not defined\"\n\n**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**\n\n```python\ndef function(input):\n    return expected\n```\n\n**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**\n\nRun: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`\nExpected: PASS\n\n**Step 5: Commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py\ngit commit -m \"feat: add specific feature\"\n```\n```\n\n## Remember\n- Exact file paths always\n- Complete code in plan (not \"add validation\")\n- Exact commands with expected output\n- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax\n- Include Dependencies field for every task (required for parallel execution)\n- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits\n\n## Context Management\n\n**Compact before validation** — plan writing involves extensive codebase exploration:\n\n```\n/compact Plan written to [file path].

Recommend addressing before implementation.\"\n- **Medium Priority**: \"Some concerns raised. Would you like to review them?\"\n- **Low/None**: \"Plan validated by multi-agent review. Ready for execution.\"\n\n**Handle response:**\n- If High Priority issues → Revise plan, re-run consensus\n- If user accepts concerns → Proceed to Execution Handoff\n- If user wants to skip → Proceed (their choice)\n\n## Execution Handoff\n\n**If `CONCLAVE_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`:** Skip the choice, use Subagent-Driven automatically.

However, since the triggers ARE set up before seeding, the seed inserts WILL fire the triggers. But a rebuild ensures consistency. Actually, since `createDatabase` creates the triggers before `seedDatabase` runs, the triggers will catch the seed inserts. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, the flow is: `createDatabase` creates table + FTS table + triggers, THEN `seedDatabase` inserts data. The triggers will fire during seeding. So no rebuild is needed. BUT if we want to be safe, we can add it.\n\nLet me re-examine: `createDatabase` is called first, which creates the notes table, the FTS table, and the triggers. Then `seedDatabase` inserts rows into `notes`, which fires the `AFTER INSERT` trigger, which populates `notes_fts`. So the FTS index will already be populated after seeding.\n\n**This task may not be needed.** Only add the rebuild if tests fail without it.\n\n**Step 2: Run all tests**\n\nRun: `npx vitest run`\nExpected: All 35 tests pass\n\n---\n\n## Key Implementation Notes\n\n1. **Route ordering matters**: Search routes (`/notes/search` and `//notes/search/suggest`) MUST be registered BEFORE `/notes/:id`, otherwise Express will match \"search\" as an `:id` parameter.\n\n2. **FTS5 content sync**: Using `content='notes'` and `content_rowid='id'` creates a \"content table\" FTS5 that stores content in the original `notes` table. The triggers handle sync on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n\n3. **Query sanitization**: Special characters that are FTS5 operators (like `+`, `/`, `&`) must be stripped or escaped to prevent syntax errors. The `try/catch` around FTS queries provides additional safety.\n\n4. **BM25 ranking**: FTS5's `bm25()` returns negative values where more negative = more relevant. `ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)` naturally sorts most relevant first.\n\n5. **Snippet generation**: `snippet(notes_fts, 1, '<mark>', '</mark>', '...', 32)` extracts snippets from the body column (index 1), wrapping matches in `<mark>` tags, using `...` as ellipsis, with max 32 tokens.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":121,"cache_read_input_tokens":40265,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":121},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8e142396-8651-41ba-a836-a7c52cec9a78","uuid":"9eb50537-224e-40d2-b569-bfdbb5f74429"}

Search routes are registered before the `/notes/:id` route to avoid path conflicts.\n\n**Tech Stack:** SQLite FTS5, better-sqlite3, Express, TypeScript\n\n---\n\n### Task 1: Add FTS5 virtual table and triggers to database setup\n\n**Files:**\n- Modify: `src/db.ts:9-19` (add FTS table creation and triggers after notes table)\n\n**Dependencies:** none\n\n**Step 1: Add FTS5 table and triggers in `createDatabase`**\n\nAfter the existing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes` block (line 19), add:\n\n```typescript\n// Create FTS5 virtual table for full-text search\ndb.exec(`\n  CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes_fts USING fts5(\n    title,\n    body,\n    content='notes',\n    content_rowid='id'\n  )\n`);\n\n// Triggers to keep FTS index in sync\ndb.exec(`\n  CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_ai AFTER INSERT ON notes BEGIN\n    INSERT INTO notes_fts(rowid, title, body) VALUES (new.id, new.title, new.body);\n  END\n`);\ndb.exec(`\n  CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_ad AFTER DELETE ON notes BEGIN\n    INSERT INTO notes_fts(notes_fts, rowid, title, body) VALUES('delete', old.id, old.title, old.body);\n  END\n`);\ndb.exec(`\n  CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_au AFTER UPDATE ON notes BEGIN\n    INSERT INTO notes_fts(notes_fts, rowid, title, body) VALUES('delete', old.id, old.title, old.body);\n    INSERT INTO notes_fts(rowid, title, body) VALUES (new.id, new.title, new.body);\n  END\n`);\n```\n\n**Step 2: Run existing tests to verify nothing breaks**\n\nRun: `npx vitest run tests/notes.test.ts`\nExpected: All 15 CRUD tests pass\n\n**Step 3: Commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add src/db.ts\ngit commit -m \"feat: add FTS5 virtual table and sync triggers\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Task 2: Add search and suggest routes\n\n**Files:**\n- Modify: `src/routes.ts` (add search endpoints BEFORE the `/notes/:id` route)\n\n**Dependencies:** Task 1\n\n**Step 1: Add imports for SearchResult and SuggestResult**\n\nAt the top of `src/routes.ts`, update the import from models:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Note, NoteInput, SearchResult, SuggestResult } from './models.js';\n```\n\n**Step 2: Add the search endpoint BEFORE the `GET /notes/:id` route (before line 34)**\n\nInsert after the `GET /notes` handler (after line 32) and before `GET /notes/:id`:\n\n```typescript\n// GET /notes/search - Full-text search\nrouter.get('/notes/search', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {\n  try {\n    const q = req.query.q as string | undefined;\n    if (!q || q.trim() === '') {\n      throw new ValidationError('Search query is required');\n    }\n\n    const page = Math.max(1, parseInt(req.query.page as string) || 1);\n    const perPage = 20;\n    const offset = (page - 1) * perPage;\n\n    // Sanitize query for FTS5: remove special FTS operators that could cause errors\n    const sanitized = q.replace(/[^\\w\\s\"'-]/g, ' ').trim();\n    // If query is empty after sanitization, return empty results\n    if (!sanitized) {\n      res.json({ results: [], total: 0, page, perPage });\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // Count total matches\n    const countStmt = db.prepare(`\n      SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM notes_fts WHERE notes_fts MATCH ?\n    `);\n\n    let total: number;\n    let results: SearchResult[];\n\n    try {\n      total = (countStmt.get(sanitized) as { total: number }).total;\n\n      const searchStmt = db.prepare(`\n        SELECT\n          notes.id,\n          notes.title,\n          snippet(notes_fts, 1, '<mark>', '</mark>', '...', 32) as snippet,\n          bm25(notes_fts) as rank\n        FROM notes_fts\n        JOIN notes ON notes.id = notes_fts.rowid\n        WHERE notes_fts MATCH ?\n        ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)\n        LIMIT ?

However, since the triggers ARE set up before seeding, the seed inserts WILL fire the triggers. But a rebuild ensures consistency. Actually, since `createDatabase` creates the triggers before `seedDatabase` runs, the triggers will catch the seed inserts. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, the flow is: `createDatabase` creates table + FTS table + triggers, THEN `seedDatabase` inserts data. The triggers will fire during seeding. So no rebuild is needed. BUT if we want to be safe, we can add it.\n\nLet me re-examine: `createDatabase` is called first, which creates the notes table, the FTS table, and the triggers. Then `seedDatabase` inserts rows into `notes`, which fires the `AFTER INSERT` trigger, which populates `notes_fts`. So the FTS index will already be populated after seeding.\n\n**This task may not be needed.** Only add the rebuild if tests fail without it.\n\n**Step 2: Run all tests**\n\nRun: `npx vitest run`\nExpected: All 35 tests pass\n\n---\n\n## Key Implementation Notes\n\n1. **Route ordering matters**: Search routes (`/notes/search` and `//notes/search/suggest`) MUST be registered BEFORE `/notes/:id`, otherwise Express will match \"search\" as an `:id` parameter.\n\n2. **FTS5 content sync**: Using `content='notes'` and `content_rowid='id'` creates a \"content table\" FTS5 that stores content in the original `notes` table. The triggers handle sync on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.\n\n3. **Query sanitization**: Special characters that are FTS5 operators (like `+`, `/`, `&`) must be stripped or escaped to prevent syntax errors. The `try/catch` around FTS queries provides additional safety.\n\n4. **BM25 ranking**: FTS5's `bm25()` returns negative values where more negative = more relevant. `ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)` naturally sorts most relevant first.\n\n5. **Snippet generation**: `snippet(notes_fts, 1, '<mark>', '</mark>', '...', 32)` extracts snippets from the body column (index 1), wrapping matches in `<mark>` tags, using `...` as ellipsis, with max 32 tokens.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}

IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?\n2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)\n3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures\n4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?\n   - If NO: State actual status with evidence\n   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence\n5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim\n\nSkip any step = lying, not verifying\n```\n\n## Common Failures\n\n| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |\n|-------|----------|----------------|\n| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, \"should pass\" |\n| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |\n| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |\n| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |\n| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |\n| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports \"success\" |\n| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |\n\n## Red Flags - STOP\n\n- Using \"should\", \"probably\", \"seems to\"\n- Expressing satisfaction before verification (\"Great!\", \"Perfect!\", \"Done!\", etc.)\n- About to commit/push/PR without verification\n- Trusting agent success reports\n- Relying on partial verification\n- Thinking \"just this once\"\n- Tired and wanting work over\n- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**\n\n## Rationalization Prevention\n\n| Excuse | Reality |\n|--------|---------|\n| \"Should work now\" | RUN the verification |\n| \"I'm confident\" | Confidence ≠ evidence |\n| \"Just this once\" | No exceptions |\n| \"Linter passed\" | Linter ≠ compiler |\n| \"Agent said success\" | Verify independently |\n| \"I'm tired\" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |\n| \"Partial check is enough\" | Partial proves nothing |\n| \"Different words so rule doesn't apply\" | Spirit over letter |\n\n## Key Patterns\n\n**Tests:**\n```\n✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] \"All tests pass\"\n❌ \"Should pass now\" / \"Looks correct\"\n```\n\n**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**\n```\n✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)\n❌ \"I've written a regression test\" (without red-green verification)\n```\n\n**Build:**\n```\n✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] \"Build passes\"\n❌ \"Linter passed\" (linter doesn't check compilation)\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n```\n✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion\n❌ \"Tests pass, phase complete\"\n```\n\n**Agent delegation:**\n```\n✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state\n❌ Trust agent report\n```\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nFrom 24 failure memories:\n- your human partner said \"I don't believe you\" - trust broken\n- Undefined functions shipped - would crash\n- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features\n- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework\n- Violates: \"Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced.\"\n\n## When To Apply\n\n**ALWAYS before:**\n- ANY variation of success/completion claims\n- ANY expression of satisfaction\n- ANY positive statement about work state\n- Committing, PR creation, task completion\n- Moving to next task\n- Delegating to agents\n\n**Rule applies to:**\n- Exact phrases\n- Paraphrases and synonyms\n- Implications of success\n- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness\n\n## Multi-Agent Final Verification (For Significant Work)\n\n**When to use:** Before claiming completion on significant features, bug fixes, or refactors.\n\n**When to skip:** Trivial changes, typos, single-line fixes.\n\nAfter local verification passes, run multi-agent consensus on the changes:\n\n```bash\n# Auto-detects base SHA, reviews all changes\nconclave auto-review \"Final verification: <description>\"\n```\n\n**Present results:**\n- **High Priority issues**: \"Consensus found issues. Must address before claiming complete.\"\n- **Medium Priority**: \"Some concerns raised. Review before finalizing.\"\n- **Consider only**: \"Verified by local tests AND multi-agent review. Work complete.\"\n\n**This catches:**\n- Issues your tests don't cover\n- Patterns that look wrong to fresh eyes\n- Edge cases you didn't consider\n- Security or performance concerns\n\n**The enhanced gate function for significant work:**\n```\n1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?\n2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)\n3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures\n4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?\n5. CONSENSUS: Run multi-agent review on changes\n6. ONLY THEN: Make the claim\n```\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**No shortcuts for verification.**\n\nRun the command. Read the output. Get consensus on significant work. THEN claim the result.\n\nThis is non-negotiable.\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8e142396-8651-41ba-a836-a7c52cec9a78","uuid":"5afdc623-0e1b-487d-a699-06cf34581edc","isSynthetic":true}

+# Full-Text Search Feature Implementation Plan
+
+> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use conclave:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.
+
+**Goal:** Add SQLite FTS5 full-text search with search and suggest endpoints to the existing notes API.
+
+**Architecture:** Create an FTS5 virtual table (`notes_fts`) synced with the `notes` table via SQLite triggers. Add two new endpoints (`/notes/search` and `/notes/search/suggest`) that query the FTS index. Search routes are registered before the `/notes/:id` route to avoid path conflicts.
+
+**Tech Stack:** SQLite FTS5, better-sqlite3, Express, TypeScript
+
+---
+
+### Task 1: Add FTS5 virtual table and triggers to database setup
+
+**Files:**
+- Modify: `src/db.ts:9-19` (add FTS table creation and triggers after notes table)
+
+**Dependencies:** none
+
+**Step 1: Add FTS5 table and triggers in `createDatabase`**
+
+After the existing `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes` block (line 19), add:
+
+```typescript
+// Create FTS5 virtual table for full-text search
+db.exec(`
+  CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes_fts USING fts5(
+    title,
+    body,
+    content='notes',
+    content_rowid='id'
+  )
+`);
+
+// Triggers to keep FTS index in sync
+db.exec(`
+  CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_ai AFTER INSERT ON notes BEGIN
+    INSERT INTO notes_fts(rowid, title, body) VALUES (new.id, new.title, new.body);
+  END
+`);
+db.exec(`
+  CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_ad AFTER DELETE ON notes BEGIN
+    INSERT INTO notes_fts(notes_fts, rowid, title, body) VALUES('delete', old.id, old.title, old.body);
+  END
+`);
+db.exec(`
+  CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS notes_au AFTER UPDATE ON notes BEGIN
+    INSERT INTO notes_fts(notes_fts, rowid, title, body) VALUES('delete', old.id, old.title, old.body);
+    INSERT INTO notes_fts(rowid, title, body) VALUES (new.id, new.title, new.body);
+  END
+`);
+```
+
+**Step 2: Run existing tests to verify nothing breaks**
+
+Run: `npx vitest run tests/notes.test.ts`
+Expected: All 15 CRUD tests pass
+
+**Step 3: Commit**
+
+```bash
+git add src/db.ts
+git commit -m "feat: add FTS5 virtual table and sync triggers"
+```
+
+---
+
+### Task 2: Add search and suggest routes
+
+**Files:**
+- Modify: `src/routes.ts` (add search endpoints BEFORE the `/notes/:id` route)
+
+**Dependencies:** Task 1
+
+**Step 1: Add imports for SearchResult and SuggestResult**
+
+At the top of `src/routes.ts`, update the import from models:
+
+```typescript
+import { Note, NoteInput, SearchResult, SuggestResult } from './models.js';
+```
+
+**Step 2: Add the search endpoint BEFORE the `GET /notes/:id` route (before line 34)**
+
+Insert after the `GET /notes` handler (after line 32) and before `GET /notes/:id`:
+
+```typescript
+// GET /notes/search - Full-text search
+router.get('/notes/search', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
+  try {
+    const q = req.query.q as string | undefined;
+    if (!q || q.trim() === '') {
+      throw new ValidationError('Search query is required');
+    }
+
+    const page = Math.max(1, parseInt(req.query.page as string) || 1);
+    const perPage = 20;
+    const offset = (page - 1) * perPage;
+
+    // Sanitize query for FTS5: remove special FTS operators that could cause errors
+    const sanitized = q.replace(/[^\w\s"'-]/g, ' ').trim();
+    // If query is empty after sanitization, return empty results
+    if (!sanitized) {
+      res.json({ results: [], total: 0, page, perPage });
+      return;
+    }
+
+    // Count total matches
+    const countStmt = db.prepare(`
+      SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM notes_fts WHERE notes_fts MATCH ?
+    `);
+
+    let total: number;
+    let results: SearchResult[];
+
+    try {
+      total = (countStmt.get(sanitized) as { total: number }).total;
+
+      const searchStmt = db.prepare(`
+        SELECT
+          notes.id,
+          notes.title,
+          snippet(notes_fts, 1, '<mark>', '</mark>', '...', 32) as snippet,
+          bm25(notes_fts) as rank
+        FROM notes_fts
+        JOIN notes ON notes.id = notes_fts.rowid
+        WHERE notes_fts MATCH ?
+        ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)
+        LIMIT ? OFFSET ?
+      `);
+
+      results = searchStmt.all(sanitized, perPage, offset) as SearchResult[];
+    } catch {
+      // If FTS query syntax is invalid, return empty results
+      total = 0;
+      results = [];
+    }
+
+    res.json({ results, total, page, perPage });
+  } catch (err) {
+    next(err);
+  }
+});
+
+// GET /notes/search/suggest - Autocomplete suggestions
+router.get('/notes/search/suggest', (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
+  try {
+    const q = req.query.q as string | undefined;
+    if (!q || q.trim() === '') {
+      throw new ValidationError('Search query is required');
+    }
+
+    // Use prefix query for autocomplete
+    const sanitized = q.replace(/[^\w\s'-]/g, '').trim();
+    if (!sanitized) {
+      res.json({ results: [] });
+      return;
+    }
+
+    const prefixQuery = sanitized.split(/\s+/).map(term => `"${term}"*`).join(' ');
+
+    let results: SuggestResult[];
+    try {
+      const suggestStmt = db.prepare(`
+        SELECT notes.id, notes.title
+        FROM notes_fts
+        JOIN notes ON notes.id = notes_fts.rowid
+        WHERE notes_fts MATCH ?
+        ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)
+        LIMIT 5
+      `);
+      results = suggestStmt.all(prefixQuery) as SuggestResult[];
+    } catch {
+      results = [];
+    }
+
+    res.json({ results });
+  } catch (err) {
+    next(err);
+  }
+});
+```
+
+**Step 3: Run all tests**
+
+Run: `npx vitest run`
+Expected: All 35 tests pass
+
+**Step 4: Commit**
+
+```bash
+git add src/routes.ts
+git commit -m "feat: add search and suggest endpoints with FTS5"
+```
+
+---
+
+### Task 3: Populate FTS index for seeded data
+
+**Files:**
+- Modify: `src/db.ts:24-37` (add FTS rebuild after seed insert)
+
+**Dependencies:** Task 1
+
+**Step 1: Add FTS rebuild in `seedDatabase` function**
+
+After `insertMany(notes)` (line 37), add:
+
+```typescript
+// Rebuild FTS index to include seeded data
+db.exec(`INSERT INTO notes_fts(notes_fts) VALUES('rebuild')`);
+```
+
+This is needed because the triggers only fire for new inserts AFTER the triggers exist, but `seedDatabase` is called after `createDatabase` which already sets up triggers. However, since the triggers ARE set up before seeding, the seed inserts WILL fire the triggers. But a rebuild ensures consistency. Actually, since `createDatabase` creates the triggers before `seedDatabase` runs, the triggers will catch the seed inserts. Let me reconsider...
+
+Actually, the flow is: `createDatabase` creates table + FTS table + triggers, THEN `seedDatabase` inserts data. The triggers will fire during seeding. So no rebuild is needed. BUT if we want to be safe, we can add it.
+
+Let me re-examine: `createDatabase` is called first, which creates the notes table, the FTS table, and the triggers. Then `seedDatabase` inserts rows into `notes`, which fires the `AFTER INSERT` trigger, which populates `notes_fts`. So the FTS index will already be populated after seeding.
+
+**This task may not be needed.** Only add the rebuild if tests fail without it.
+
+**Step 2: Run all tests**
+
+Run: `npx vitest run`
+Expected: All 35 tests pass
+
+---
+
+## Key Implementation Notes
+
+1. **Route ordering matters**: Search routes (`/notes/search` and `//notes/search/suggest`) MUST be registered BEFORE `/notes/:id`, otherwise Express will match "search" as an `:id` parameter.
+
+2. **FTS5 content sync**: Using `content='notes'` and `content_rowid='id'` creates a "content table" FTS5 that stores content in the original `notes` table. The triggers handle sync on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
+
+3. **Query sanitization**: Special characters that are FTS5 operators (like `+`, `/`, `&`) must be stripped or escaped to prevent syntax errors. The `try/catch` around FTS queries provides additional safety.
+
+4. **BM25 ranking**: FTS5's `bm25()` returns negative values where more negative = more relevant. `ORDER BY bm25(notes_fts)` naturally sorts most relevant first.
+
+5. **Snippet generation**: `snippet(notes_fts, 1, '<mark>', '</mark>', '...', 32)` extracts snippets from the body column (index 1), wrapping matches in `<mark>` tags, using `...` as ellipsis, with max 32 tokens.
