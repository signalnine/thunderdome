+You have agent teams enabled (CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1). For complex tasks, create an agent team to tackle the work with parallel teammates. Break the work into independent pieces and assign each to a teammate. Use delegate mode — coordinate and assign, don't implement everything yourself.

+When all work is complete and tests pass, type /exit to end the session. -- # Task Queue System Build a fully-featured in-memory task queue system from scratch. The system should grow incrementally through 12 phases, each introducing new capabilities that build on the foundation laid by earlier phases. ## Overview Your task queue should support adding tasks, processing them, and managing their lifecycle. Think of it like a simplified version of systems like Bull, BeeQueue, or Celery -- but entirely in-memory with no external dependencies. The system evolves through 12 phases of increasing sophistication: 1. **Basic queue** -- adding and processing tasks in order 2. **Named queues** -- multiple independent queues 3. **Priority** -- some tasks are more urgent than others 4. **Delayed tasks** -- tasks that should wait before becoming available 5. **Retry with backoff** -- automatic retry when tasks fail 6. **Dead letter queue** -- permanent storage for repeatedly-failing tasks 7. **Task dependencies** -- tasks that wait for other tasks to finish 8. **Concurrency control** -- limiting how many tasks run at once 9. **Progress and cancellation** -- tracking and aborting work 10. **Recurring tasks** -- cron-like scheduled task creation 11. **Middleware** -- intercepting and transforming tasks in a pipeline 12. **Graceful shutdown** -- orderly wind-down of the system Read `phases/*.md` for detailed requirements for each phase. ## Getting Started - Export your main API from `src/index.ts` - All implementation should live under `src/` - No external runtime dependencies allowed (dev dependencies are pre-installed) - Write your own tests as you go to verify your implementation ## Validation ```bash npm run build # TypeScript must compile npm run lint # No lint errors ``` ## Tips - Later phases will force you to rethink early decisions. Design with extensibility in mind. - Tasks should have unique identifiers and track their lifecycle status. - Consider how features like priorities, delays, and dependencies interact with each other.
